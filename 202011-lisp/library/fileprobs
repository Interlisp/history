CMLARRAY-SUPPORT is in Library but also in sources.

I have newer source for FOREIGN-FUNCTION in /project/medley3.5/library/, which I must have gotten from Jarl.  But my compiled file is not compiled on the newest source.

I have newer version of keyboardeditor, I think from my own edits.  Have to merge in at some point.

I have sources for LAFITE that don't seem to exist in your library directory.  Do you have them somewhere else?  I don't know if mine are the newest.  In particular, my LCOM for LAFITEFIND is on a newer version than my source.

Your TEDITDECLS.LCOM seems to be compiled on a slightly later version (a few minutes) than the source file that you have.
