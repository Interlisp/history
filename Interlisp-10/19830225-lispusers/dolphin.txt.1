  The function INFILEP works strangely on the dolphin. If I am connected to
a directory on the IFS, INFILEP returns NIL no matter what I try. The only
circumstance when INFILEP returns anything other than NIL is if I am connected
to the disk, and do (INFILEP 'FOO) where FOO is on the disk. However
(INFILEP '{DSK}FOO) gives NIL if I connect to the IFS.
The lisp comes from {IFS}<DOLPHIN>LISP>LISP.SYSOUT.

I found and solved that problem already.  Seems that some of the ifs
directories have a funny protection which allows files to be read
i.e. (INFILE 'FOO) works fine, but not to be "seen" (INFILEP 'FOO) returns
NIL.  However, I just noticed this is similar but not identical
to Armin's bug of not understanding files on the DSK when connected to
IFS.  The next test is to try INFILE at both places.

How come old fixes are not generalized or made real fixes. For example,
in this case, made sure that all the IFS directories where of the right 
protection. And have Mark Roberts change the protection of all the HPP
directories so that they get compatible with the LISP or have XEROX change
the LISP so that it would work independantly of the type of directory protection.

Thought I did do that for the directories, Rene'.  How was your vacation?

My vacations went very well, thank you. We stayed a few days in Mexico City,
then moved to Oaxaca (where we visited two archeological sites : Mitla and Monte Alban and the museum. Ate out all the time. The we went to Villa Hermosa (which it is not, Hermosa I mean) which we used as a start point to visit Palenque,
a mgnificent Maya site. Next we move to Merida, which allowed us to visit
Uxmal and Chichen Itza. Both very interesting MAya ruins.

As you can imagine, a very busy and tiring trip, but worthwhile, a thousand times.

Will you be in tomorrow, Peter ?

See you soon
