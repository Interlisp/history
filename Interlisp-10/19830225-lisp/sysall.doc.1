SYSOUT-SEARCH

I've just written a program which you might be interested in.  You give
it the name of a makesys and a file with a list of directory names; it
then goes thru those directories, looking for sysout's that come from
that makesys.

I developed it for use at SUMEX, since they are especially concerned
that an older version of LISP might be deleted while someone needed it.
However, people at other sites might be interested in using it before
deleting an old version.

The program  will also (optionally) send a message to the owners of the
files; the names of their sysout's are appended to an initial message
that you supply.

The "users list" file can also contain entries of the form
username:directory,directory,..., so that non-login directories can be
correctly associated with their owners. For example, at parc it might be
TEITELMAN:TEITELMAN,NEWLISP,SPAGHETTI
WALKER:WALKER,HELPSYS,MANUAL
MASINTER
KAPLAN:KAPLAN,RMK

If you want to check the entire system, you can just give it
"yourname:*" as the single entry.

It works by stepping thru the given directories, first looking for files
larger than "SmallestSysout" (currently set at 75 pages; if you
immediately do a sysout after startup, you can get a smaller one, but I
assume that they are not of much interest)

For those files which are big enough, it checks rh word 2 for 140q, word
3 for SYSOUT in sixbit, word 4 for same as the makesys's date, and word
5.... for the right name.

For pre-overlay makesys's (yes, SUMEX still has a couple of those
around) it checks word 2777q for the sysdate and word 2000q on for the
right name.

PROGRAM OPERATION:

When you start it, it asks:

"Makesys: "  respond with the name of the makesys you want to check
(e.g. <SUBSYS>LISP.SAV)

Then it asks "Send message to owners? " respond either Y or N.

If you say Yes, it will ask you for the name of an "initial message
file". This should be a text file which you create with TECO or POET
which contains the main body of the message you want sent out.  Each
message will have appended to it the name of the makesys, followed by a
line with "-------------" followed by a list of all of their sysout's.

If you say No, it will ask you for the name of a file where you want the
names of the sysout's listed. You can of course say TTY: to get them
typed on the terminal.

Finally, it asks for the name of the "users" file. This file should
contain, one per line, either a single username, or
username:dir,dir,dir,....   The initial username is the person to whom
the message is sent (his directory is not automatically checked, you
must say TEITELMAN:TEITELMAN,NEWLISP if you want to check it as well).

Optionally the file can contain just "yourname:*" to check the entire
system.

Notes:

     (1) people might have files that are read protected from you.  The
     program cannot see these if you are not enabled.

      (2) If a file has the same makesysdate, but it contains the name
     of a different parent (e.g. <SUBSYS>NEWLISP and <SPAGHETTI>TEST
     are identical at PARC) then it does not include the file name in
     any message it sends out, but prints the name on the terminal.
     If you are NOT sending messages, it just includes it   in the list
     file.

       (3) Sending a message to other network sites is not yet
     implemented, but may be shortly.

       (4) currently, very little checking is done on the validity of
     the addressee's name. it will just create a file which MAILER
     will complain about.

       (5) It does not call MAILER directly. Therefore, the messages may
     not get sent for a while (I believe that MAILER is guaranteed
     to look at every [--UNSENT-MAIL--] file every 24 hours).
     Until I find out how to diddle the mailer, if you want the
     messages to go out immediately, you must run the MAILER
     program yourself.

Enjoy.
