DATESORT[Internal Lafite Utility]Datesort places an item on the background menu.  When selected you will be prompted for the name of a Lafite Mail folder to be sorted, and the name of a new resulting sorted folder.  The folder messages will then be sorted in ascending order on their "Date:" fields (this takes some time).
