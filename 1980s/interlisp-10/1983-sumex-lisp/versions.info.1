available on SUMEX.

	Version 70505 of Lisp represents the first version designed
to be runable on either a DEC-10/Tenex or DEC-10/Tops20 system.  Tops20
is a DEC designed and supported operating system, similar to, and based
upon, Tenex.  The parent Lisp, obtained from Xerox-PARC, can be 
moved directly to either system, and if named according to local
conventions, can be expected to support programs written on either
system in the same Lisp.  This is a way of saying that an increase in
transportability of programs can be expected with this and subsequent
versions of Lisp.

	The 70110 version of Lisp corrects a bug which manifested   
itself as a totally unresponsive state, from which cntrl-C was the 
only possible exit.  This situation was known to occur when generating
new atoms, usually via GENSYM.  See Sumex.bbd under topic
languages.lisp for example.
 
	If you are currently using 50104 for any programs, you should
be in the process of translating your code to a newer version of
Lisp.  Bill White has a function which may be helpful, and which is
designed to help translate from 50104 to 61027.  Contact <WHITE> for
further details.

	<DENDRAL>CARHART.SAV;9 is a version of Small Lisp (see
<DOC>LISP-SMALL-SLISP.INFO for details) which corresponds to the
shallow binding Lisps.  This version of Small Lisp is currently
pointed to by <SUBSYS>SLISP.  A new version of Small Lisp, generated
from the July 2, 1977 version of Interlisp is available as
<LISP>CARHART.SAV;70702. On the first of August, <SUBSYS>SLISP wil be
made to point to this newer version of Small Lisp.
