Hello.  I am praticing being aninterlisp hacker,
but I have one problem.

How can I turn off the spelling corrector?  It is
driving me crazy when I load in files that I know are fine.

Or maybe I could tell it about the words it doesnt like (put
them in its dictionary) so it wouldnt ask me?

Regards etc.

Subject: LISP function library prototype
To:   siglunch:

As I discussed during SIGLUNCH a few weeks ago, I have created a
prototype system which acts as a LISP function library. The system
deals with LISP functions and files. Every function available is
placed into one or more categories, or files, according to some
common features of the functions. A user can perform tasks which
provide information about the files and functions; and then select
subsets of the functions to be placed on a separate file for use in
other LISP systems.

Anyone can use the system by running <WCW>UTIL , which causes you to
first be asked if you want to see "task timing info in terminal
output". Since, in this application, you are probably not interested
in recording the execution time of the various tasks, you should
answer this question with a "N". Next you will be asked "what do you
want to do?". At this point, you may ask for any of the tasks known
to the program; and you can find out what is available by typing "?".

Please take some time to try out what is currently in the system, and
then send me your comments and suggestions.  There are probably a lot
of things that can be done, depending on how useful they might be.
Please SNDMSG to WHITE, or call me at 7-4878 or (415)961-4837.

Yep, that's right.  It's a homemade lisp that lacks some of the larger
lisp packages (e.g. compiler and masterscope).  It is somewhere between
the tiny <lisp>carhart and the huge <lisp>lisp.  It is quite unofficial;
we use it just for mycin.  I once discussed with Suzanne the possibility
of making it available to the general community, but since <lisp> is
chronically over allocation we never did.

I would appreciate such information being distributed to people in

to know how and why.

Do you have the corresponding <carhart>lisp (small version)?  How
much space (lists and other data types) is there in the new version
as compared to the current lisp?

Hopefully it is easy for you to get answers to those questions, because
they are important to our continuing development.

To:   ACHENBACH

Mike,
	I have found that under certain circumstances, the LISP compiler 
ignores apparently valid LISP statements.  This is demonstrated in the
following example which shows
1)	The execution of the compiled function.
2)	Printout of the function.  Function then harmlessly modified
	(NIL -> NIL)
3)	Function run interpretively.  Now the missing statement is
	executed.
4)	The problem seems to center around the NULL loop -- that is, the
	(for x in lst do (progn NIL)) -- because statements after this
	are ignored by the compiler.  In my real example, this NULL loop
	was an artifact from a machine-generated procedure.

I prefer the former.  It looks mechanistic, which is how I view
GC's.  The other form could too easily come from the program, and
not from LISP.  I'm sure I have a program around here somewhere
which "collects lists" of some for or other.

Subject: stack overflow in interlisp
To:   ACHENBACH
cc:   faught

Hi.  I noticed that when I run a large interlisp job with
lots of recursion, I get a STACK OVERFLOW message often.
It seems to happen on small lists (less than 100 items)
on functions that CDR down the list,
looking for something, and then build it back up with CONSes.

Is this a common problem?  Is there a way to increase the stack
size?  I found it possible to do MINFs and RECLAIM on type 5
(stack ptrs) but not on type 2, which (I think) is where the
stack is.

Also, it seems that interlisp doesnt clean up the stack
very well.  When I type

(FOR I FROM 1 TO 100 DO (FOO) (PRINT I))

(where FOO is a function that adds things on to lists)
I get to about 68 and then STACK OVERFLOW.  However, if I
control-D and then say (FOO), it doesnt overflow.  
In fact, if I do the same FOR statement again to 100, it takes
until about 50 to overflow again.  This implies that every time
(FOO) is called, lisp is leaving some stuff on the stack
which doesnt get garbage collected until a GC or until
a control-D.  Is my perception correct, and what can I do about it?

Thanks for any info you have on this.

I think I like GC: xxx, but also would like to be able to have it
print some sting of my own choosing, without an extra CRLF.  

In particular, I would like to be able to print (say) "[" when a
list GC begins and "]" when it ends, "<" when a string GC begins and
">" when that ends, etc.  THis is nice when you have a program that
does hundreds of GC's with occasional output.  You can estimate when
it's thrashing by watching the gc output, without losing your normal
output among hundreds of lines, perhaps rolled off the screen.

HOW COME THE AMOUNT OF LIST SPACE USED INCREASSES SUBSTANTIALLY

THE REASON IS THAT THE RESULTS OF THE CALL TO STORAGE

SPACE TO DO SO. IF YOU USE CONTROL-W (I.E. ^W(STORAGE)) THEN
THERE IS NO INCREASE.

I should have sent you a message about that. The new version of <LISP>LISP is
in fact the most recent 'export' release available, and corresponds most closely to
the manual. Warren has not yet sent out a 'release' message to the world, and he
may want to load up another lisp before doing so. However, there were one or
two people at SUMEX who I had given some programs to which required the
newer lisp to run and shipped it over there without thinking about it too much.
I guess I would advise you not to change system pointers around to point to this
version (which corresponds to PARC version 125) until you hear from Warren.

Please try to calm Bill White. He called me twice yesterday (but I was out).

(FRPLNODE2 broken) is an ambiguous message -- the line before says what the
problem is; i.e. it is either u.d.f. FRPLNODE2, or ARG NOT LIST, or ATTEMPT
TO RPLAC NIL.

Diagnosing the problem depends a little more on the context; did the problem
happen when actually attempting to LOAD the program, or did it happen when
attempting to RUN his program in CARHART.SAV? Is it really the case that he
did the exact same thing inside his LISP.SAV and the CARHART.SAV.

It is possible (but not likely) that there is an incompatibility in this LISP.SAV
which would require making a new CARHART.SAV; I imagine I should do that
relatively soon.

I would appreciate it if you could help him out a bit.

Jan -
     I had a couple questions about converting UCI Lisp to INTERLISP --
I wasn't sure if you were who I should be bothering with things like
this, but you seemed a good guess. Let me know if otherwise. Anyway...

(a) My UCI files are commented with lines that begin with a semicolon
(the redefined comment character); the scanner then ignores that line
on input. Can INTERLISP be made to do the same -- simply ignore any

input line beginning with some character, or do I have to rewrite
them into the (* ... ) format?
(b) Can INTERLISP read in an "initialization file" (a la INIT.LSP
in UCI Lisp), so I don't have to keep typing (RAISE T), etc. every

time I start up, or is there some other way of doing this?

Thanks much --
Jim

Mike-  Could you please answer these questions from JMiller. I obviously
don't know the answers. Please cc: me, cause I would like to know too.

     Thanks much. I was curious about being able to reset, perhaps
delete and control-x to do character and line delete, but couldn't
get setsyntax to do it right -- is this the right command? Looking at your

Mike --
     My latest excursion into INTERLISP makes me think that there
are some functions defind in the manual (Oct '78 version) that are
not in this system -- PRINTOUT and LEQ, for instance. Is there
(a) another version about with these, (b) a set of files with their
definitions, or (c) a list of the functions really on the system about
somewhere?
     I appreciate your patience on my questions -- I'll try to keep them
to an absolute minimum. Thanks.

Mike:
     There may be a bug in <lisp>lisp: please see my file 
<JMILLER>INTERLISP.BUG. This contains a function SETUP that
does a bunch of SETQ's on global variables -- this was supposed to
set up some definitions so I could test out a function. Unfortunately,
it bombs out on the (SETQ P3 '(R3 B D)), giving a u.d.f error on R3!!.
The file loads ok and executes properly on the system version of
lisp, however (what you get with @lisp). Am I doing something wrong, or what??

     I also had another problem recently -- a function was doing 
ADDPROPs, and would (so far as I can tell) put the value onto BOTH
of the two properties on the atom's list (I had only asked for it to be
put on one). Unfortunately (??) I don't have the code for this anymore.

     Presuming there's a problem with <lisp>lisp: is there another version
around with PRINTOUT? I've kind of locked myself into using that. 
Help!?!?!

Thanks,

If FRPLNODE2 is not defined in that CARHART.SAV and RPLNODE2 is, then
you can just do a MOVD(RPLNODE2 FRPLNODE2). (since FRPLNODE2 is just
supposed to be a 'fast' version of RPLNODE2; I am a bit suprised it wasn't
'compiled open').

Otherwise, I imagine the definition can be dug up, or the original code changed
not to use it.

You might even want to get into the loop of making up the 'small lisp' yourself
(I believe the MYCIN people regularly load up their own lisp system starting
with the system files from PARC; you might even arrange with Bill van Melle to
share the disk space somehow).

Bill is familiar with the proceedure. What you need to do is to start with
[parc-maxc2]<netlisp>loadup.sav, have all of the needed .COM files around (for
the files which are on SYSFILES inside CARHART.SAV which are not in
SYSFILES in LOADUP.SAV; I don't know what they are), and then say

LOADUP((names of those files))
MAKESYS(CARHART.SAV;version number).


I think the files that you need for CARHART lisp include
DATATYPE.COM, MAC.COM, BREAK.COM, HELPDL.COM, ADVISE.COM,
although I am sure there are more (which you can find out by comparing the
values of SYSFILES).

Larry

(p.s. I will fix the compiler so that it doesn't generate FRPLNODE2's in the
future).

Dammit, I just checked in the new lisp which is at SUMEX, and FRPLNODE2
has a macro and should not be appearing in calls from compiled code (unless this
is old compiled code, in which case, the problem doesn't have anything to do
with the new lisp system).

WE are using the newest INTERLISP (the one that is gotten when one
types "run <lisp> lisp".  In this version the pattern matching
facilities of CLISP are not in core and must be read in from 
a file (via the filedef property of the function -- as in the
function Makematch).  Unfortunately this file is not on the Lisp
directory.  I FTPed it from PARC.  It is <ANDERSON>MATCH.COM.
Shouldn't it be on the LISP directory??       -dave

     Is there a problem with the pattern matcher in <lisp>Lisp? It doesn't

u.d.f

In-Reply-To: TEITELMAN's message of 6 Feb 79 02:16

I don't think I explain the problem well enough.  Perhaps an example will
make things clearer.  Below is a dribble file that shows what is 
happening.  In this case a core image was made with actfbase version
number 196.  Since that core image was  made another makefile was done
on actfbase because a cheange was made to function "enterprod".  There
is now a version 197.  This brings us up toi the dribble file below.

1)  I load the core image.   "@actf"
2)I edit another function in actfbase "SAY".
3) I do a makefile on actfbase.
4) I pretty print the ENTERPROD that is on the latest version of actfbase.
5) I then pretty print the ENTERPROD that is on the N-1 version of actfbase.
     -this is 197.
6)  The difference show show makefile got its definition of ENTERPROD from
        version 196, not the latest version, which was 197.

-dave
p.s.  We don't have INTERLISP at cmua (being TOPS-10).  However our
computation center has Interlisp (its about a year old now) and
it was Bruce Nelson @CMUA who put it up there.  I am using Interlisp at SUMEX .

CC:   neves+neves @ sumex
Message-ID: <05Feb79 172952 DN10@CMU-10A>

I am having problems with the file package in lisp at sumex.  

Symptom:  People in the project I am working on have had problems in
losing definitions that they have changed and saved on file.  The
definitions seem to be on one version of the file and disappear on
the next.

Environment:  We are running a large simulation program.  Because it
would take a long time to recompile it after every change we have
both a core image of the system plus a file containing changes
made since the core image  was last changed.

Hypothesis:  From what I understand of the function MAKEFILE when
it needs a file to copy functions from (i.e. sourcefile) it looks
at the version number of the filecoms that is in core.  For our
system this means the version of the file that was saved with the core
image.  If we make several changes to a file MAKEFILE will be copying
definitions from the old version and some of the changes will be lost
because they were on newer versions of the file.


Solution:  We were doing something like "MAKEFILE(FILENAME)".  I read
about makefile and thought that I could specify that the file MAKEFILE
would use to copy definitions from would be the newest version by saying
makefile(FILENAME NIL NIL FILENAME)  or makefile(FILENAME NIL NIL T).
This didn't work.

Question:  Can you help me??

as the new manual now states, pattern match is contained
in the file match.com and is not a standard part of the
lisp loadup which is why it is in section 24).
therefore, your site should also ftp the file match.com
from netlisp, if users want to use the paatern match compiler,
and install thatfile either on <lisp> or <lispusers>.

Thanks for making HASH available.  I am starting to do some experiments
with it and will let you know how well it serves our purposes.  Are you
aware of any timing studies that have been done on the package?  If so
we would be interested in those results.

I also have a question about CLISP.  I find most of the clisp translations
to be useful and natural.  But I have not been able to get accustom to the 
bracket operators or the : operator when it is used to dissect a list. 

Is there something that I could put in my INIT file that would disable the
production of <>, !, !!, x:1 , etc. when I run Clispify?

Thanks,

Mike,

I have some questions regarding the new version of LISP that is due next
week.

1) Will existing sysouts based on the current LISP then not work?  I assume
that this is what you meant when you asked LISP users to up date their 
programs.

2) Will there also be a corresponding version of <LISP>CARHART.SAV available
at that time or in the near future?  If so can it be arranged so that the 
function FRPLNODE2 be resident?  (To date we have had to define it ourselves,
which may or may not be as efficient as the one in LISP).

What happened was that I changed the contents of one of the files

of garbage collections which eliminated the problem.  The best
guess Mike and I could make about the problem was that it
was caused by garbage collection, but we couldn't find any

Did we ever restore that LISP.SAV from the dumper tape to see if that
makes any difference?  I would rest easier that it is a LISP problem
if we did that and the old CTL file still fails.

Thanks for getting the file.  I now believe that the original was smashed by
LISP during a remake.  The file had just been opened for read and functions
were read properly.   Then as space dwindled to 0 free cells (evidently
when the smash occurred), the msg "rewriting file map of LITU.;38" was
received.  The file was a mess after that.

2)  Bill Clancey had GUIDON running on the Dolphin for the demo and
    his subjective feel was like SUMEX under a 3-5 load average.  Thus
    the Dolphin is roughly a KA-10.  He has not run extensively on the
    Dorado to calibrate its feel.

3)  The MIT CADR was demonstrated.  It was hard to calibrate its speed
    since it does not run INTERLISP and hence no benchmark is possible
    for a system we have experience with.  I have the impression it is
    roughly KA-10 speed.  Apparently Richard Greenblatt is still trying
    to set up a company to sell them and he is talking about something
    like half price compared to Symbolics, Inc.  That may or may not be
    real

3)  Peter Szolovits gave me some details on the current Zenith NU
    status.  MIT has 10 of them now.  They use the half speed MC68000
    chip w/o virtual addressing currently.  That will be upgraded as
    Motorola hardware makes it possible.  The machine is designed with
    a 32-bit wide internal bus -- in anticipation of either INTEL's
    coming 32-bit system or the 32-bit Motorola chip.  There are some
    packaging problems in the display and disk that cause overheating
    (these should be easily fixed).  They have an operating system, akin
    to UNIX, just working (it is written in C -- compiler runs on the
    VAX).  Note the difference between this approach and the Xerox
    machine where LISP is the environment w/o underlying operating
    system.  The NU system will support multiple processes.  It will
    come connected to one of the MIT-peculiar networks (not Ethernet).
    It is too early for any benchmarks yet.

Subject: INTERLISP Q
To: achenbach at SUMEX-AIM

I am writing a display representation language editor and for various
reasons have decided not to put the display package in the editor, like
the existence of terminal independent dpy packages, the capabilities of
altos, the advantages of local dpy for remote editing, etc., and want
to start a program running concurrently with INTERLISP. Since it is
to run while INTERLISP is running, SUBSYS isn't the right thing, but
it is close. To communicate between the two programs I'm going to use
pty's, thus (INFILE Pty#:) (OUTFILE Pty#:) seem to be just what I want.
I plan on using the following scheme to start the dpy program.
    1) Use (INFILP file) to verify/expand the file name
    2) Use (OPENFILE file INPUT NIL 36) to open the file
    3) Use (OPNJFN file) to get the jfn to pass to some ASSEMBLE code
	that will start the program running on a fork.
    4) The program will then sti the pty# to interlisp and it will
	use INFILE/OUTFILE as above.

My question is basically, what is wrong with the scheme, assuming that
I really do want ptys and a concurrent dpy program?  Should I avoid
ASSEMBLE as much as possible and use (JS ...) when possible?  What about
jsys errors?

The alto and other non-local versions will have the dpy package "above"
INTERLISP, so all this will be unused, but for now....

Thanks for your help,

Subject: INTERLISP comments
To:   ACHENBACH
cc:   RINDFLEISCH, WHITE

I have encountered a peculiar feature (bug ?) in interlisp regarding 
comments loaded from files when NORMALCOMMENTSFLG is NIL.

It appears that  comments which begin with some special characters are
not loaded as comment pointers (ie. their full text is loaded) even though
NORMALCOMMENTSFLG is NIL.  This can be demonstrated using the file
<WHITE>COMTEST.  The variable SCHARS in this file is a list of all the
characters which defeat the setting of NORMALCOMMETSFLG.

Please let me know what is going on here.  I really would like to have
all my comments loaded as comment pointers.

Apparently, READCOMMENT checks explicitly for CLisp characters and the

	My work with AGE and UNITS has gotten to the point where I am
running out of space at an alarming rate.  I am almost certainly
going to build my own age/units system around only the
execution-oriented functions, and am wondering whether it would also
be worthwhile to build a new lisp image without the compiler,
masterscope, and such. I suppose this is a two-part question: (a) can
it be done without bringing the entire arpa community to bear on the
problem, and (b) would there be sufficient space savings to make it
worth the effort?  I have checked out SLISP, but that seems too
stripped down for my needs: I would still need clisp, the file
package, and the editor, and maybe a few other things. Ideas?

	When the Interlisp manual refers to the primary file, i.e. the
terminal, when the output functions are give a file argument of either T

(jfn 101) or is actually going to JFN 777777?  We have reason to believe
that it is the latter, but would like to know for sure.  If that
is the case, then is there any way for a user to change it?

The Interlisp manual lists a number of functions contained on files

	All .COM files are on the directory <LISP>, although we don't
have all the files advertised in the manual.  I've picked up the ones
you specificaly mentioned (NET, FTP and EXEC).  We tend not to keep all
the available files on this system, since it takes up LOTS of space, but
if you ever have a need for any function, let me know and I'll get the
