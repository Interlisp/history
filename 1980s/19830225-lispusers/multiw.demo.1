windows, a single window, T or NIL.
MULTIWFREE frees the links from @i{SuperWindow} to the windows in
@i(SubWindowLst) as well as the pointers back.  If @i(SubWindowLst) is T,
then @i(SuperWindow) is freed of all its subwindows (and they of it).

@b<MULTIWADVICE ()> @>[@i(function)]

MULTIWADVICE advises functions based on the @i(scripts) in 
\MULTIWADVISEDFNS. The function returns a list of the advised functions
which should be saved if one wishes to UNADVISE the functions (which is
recommended before another call to (MULTIWADVICE)).

@b<MULTIWGRAPH (@i{SuperWindow DisplayWindow})> @>[@i(function)]

MULTIWGRAPH graphs a window relation structure in @i(DisplayWindow)
(which can be 
NIL).  Useful in debugging relationships between windows.  The 
GRAPHER package must be loaded to use this function.

@b<\MULTIWGRAPH (@i{NodeWindow})> @>[@i(function)]

Function MULTIWGRAPH uses to recursively follow down the window links.

@subheading(MultiWindow Window Functions)

Most are functionally identical to the normal window functions except they
perform the proper task on all of the subwindows and reset the window
structure.

@b<\MULTIWMOVEFN (@i{Window NewPosition})> @>[@i(function)]

@b<\MULTIWCLOSEFN (@i{Window})> @>[@i(function)]

@b<\MULTIWSHRINKFN (@i{Window})> @>[@i(function)]

@b<\MULTIWEXPANDFN (@i{Window})> @>[@i(function)]

@b<\MULTIWTOTOPFN (@i{Window})> @>[@i(function)]

@b<\MULTIWBURYFN (@i{Window})> @>[@i(function)]

@b<\MULTIWPROMPT (@i{PromptString})> @>[@i(function)]

Prints @i(PromptString) in PROMPTWINDOW and returns a 
(WHICHW (GETPOSITION))

@b(@u{NOTE:}) A demonstration of multiwindows can be found in
@b(MULTIW.DEMO).  The GRAPHER package should be loaded, as well
as @b(MUL
