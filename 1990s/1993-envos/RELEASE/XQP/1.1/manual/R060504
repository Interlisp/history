ref-6-5-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual         Section 6-5-4: Stream Position Information for Terminal I/OInput from Prolog streams which have opened the user's terminal for reading isechoed back as output to the same terminal.  This is interleaved with outputfrom other Prolog streams which have opened the user's terminal for writing.Therefore, all streams connected to the user's terminal share the same set ofposition counts and thus return the same values for each of the predicatescharacter_count/2, line_count/2, and line_position/2.  The following exampleassumes that 'user_input', 'user_output', and 'user_error' are all connected tothe user's terminal (which may not always be true if I/O is being redirected),             | ?- line_count(user, X1),                 line_count(user_input, X2),                 line_count(user_output, X3),                 line_count(user_error, X4).            X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 36 ;            no            | ?- line_position(user, X1),                 line_position(user_input, X2),                 line_position(user_output, X3),                 line_position(user_error, X4).            X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 0 ;            no            | ?- character_count(user, X1),                 character_count(user_input, X2),                 character_count(user_output, X3),                 character_count(user_error, X4).            X1 = X2 = X3 = X4 = 1304 ;            noNOTE:  All streams connected to any terminal share the same set of counts, soI/O from/to another terminal will corrupt the counts for both the user'sterminal and the other terminal.
