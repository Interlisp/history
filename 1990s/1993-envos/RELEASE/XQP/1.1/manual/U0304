user-3-4                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide        Section 3-4: Using Embedded consult/1 or compile/1 DirectivesAny Prolog source file can contain embedded commands that cause Prolog toconsult or compile additional subsidiary source files whenever it loads theprimary source file.  For example, to direct Prolog to consult a subsidiaryfile called myfile.pl, you would include the following line of text in yourprimary source file:              :- consult(myfile).The '[consulting File...]' and '[File consulted]' messages for the embeddedconsult command will be indented by one character.             [consulting /ufs/joe/myfile.pl...]             [myfile.pl consulted 2.354 sec 2346 bytes]            | ?-NOTES:   1. The ':- ' symbol is placed at the beginning of the line just as it      appears in the example above.   2. Although embedded consult/1 and compile/1 directives may be placed      anywhere in your source file, for clarity it is recommended that all      such directives be placed at the beginning of your file.   3. The command 'ensure_loaded(filename).' may be used in the same way      and is recommended over consult/1 and compile/1.
