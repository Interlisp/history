ref-14-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 14-1: DefinitionA data base reference is a term which uniquely identifies a clause or recordedterm (see {manual(ref-15)}) in the data base.  Data base references areprovided only to increase efficiency in programs that manipulate the data baseoften.  Use of a data base reference to a clause can save repeated searchesusing clause/2.  Please note that data base references adhere to the samemodularity rules as do other predicates.Consistency checking is done whenever a reference is used; any attempt to use areference to a clause which has been retracted will simply fail.There is no restriction on the use of references.  References may be includedin asserted clauses.
