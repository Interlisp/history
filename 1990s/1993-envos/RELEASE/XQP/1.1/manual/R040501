ref-4-5-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 4-5-1: Multifile DeclarationsA multifile declaration is a directive of the form             :- multifile PredSpec.appearing in a file to be consulted or compiled.  PredSpec is a predicatespecification (see {manual(ref-3-1-1)}), or a sequence of such specificationsseparated by commas.  'multifile' is a predefined prefix operator.  Forexample,             :- multifile cadence/2, gear_ratio/3.This declaration should be in the first file of a sequence of different filescontaining clauses for PredSpec.  The effect of the multifile declarationitself is to remove all existing clauses for PredSpec and give it the multifilepredicate property.  See {manual(ref-10-5)} for more information.  The only wayto remove the multifile property from a predicate is to use abolish/[1,2].  IfPredSpec has any clauses in the file in which it is declared multifile, theybecome its first clauses.  These clauses must all come after its declaration;otherwise an error will occur.  Clauses for PredSpec which are subsequentlyloaded from other files are added after existing clauses.NOTE:  The multifile declaration should be put in the first file to be loadedthat contains clauses for the predicate being declared multifile.There are two operations which can be performed upon a predicate declared asmultifile:     1. PredSpec can be reinitialized by loading the file with its multifile      declaration in it.   2. New clauses can be appended to the end of existing ones by loading      clauses from a succession of different files.  If additional clauses for PredSpec are loaded from a file which does notcontain its multifile declaration, the clauses from this file cannot be loadedagain until the file containing its multifile declaration is loaded again.  Ifyou try to do this, an error message will be printed, and the predicate willnot be changed.  Therefore, you cannot redefine, insert, or delete arbitraryclauses for PredSpec using the multifile facility (use the (dynamic)/1declaration if you want to do this).If the first clause for PredSpec is compiled (consulted), all subsequentlyappended clauses for PredSpec will be compiled (consulted), even if the userrequests that they be consulted (compiled).  If such a contradictory request ismade, a warning is given to indicate that the clauses for PredSpec in this fileare actually being compiled (consulted).When compiling or consulting additional clauses for PredSpec through the editorinterface, the message[compiling (consulting) clauses for multifile procedure PredSpec]is added to the Prolog window.If the "find-definition" command is invoked with PredSpec as an argument, thecursor will move to the first clause for PredSpec in the file which containsits multifile declaration.  The "find-more-definition" command can then beinvoked repeatedly, to step through any additional files which contain clausesfor PredSpec already loaded into Prolog.  (For more information on the"find-definition" and "find-more-definition" commands, refer to{manual(ref-12-5-4)}.)
