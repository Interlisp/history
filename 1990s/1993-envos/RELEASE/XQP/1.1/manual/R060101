ref-6-1-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 6-1-1: read(-X)read(X) reads the next term from the current input stream and unifies it withX.  The term must be followed by a full-stop.  See {manual(ref-2-8)} Thefull-stop is removed from the input stream but is not a part of the term whichis read.The term is read with respect to current operator declarations.  See{manual(ref-2-4)}, for a discussion of operators.read/1 does not do anything until the full-stop is encountered.  Thus, if youtype at top level             | ?- read(X)you will keep getting prompts (first '|: ', and five spaces thereafter) everytime you type the return key, but nothing else will happen, whatever you type,until you type a full-stop.When a syntax error is encountered, an error message is printed and then read/1tries again, starting immediately after the full-stop which terminated theerroneous "term".  That is, read/1 does not fail on a syntax error, butperseveres until it eventually manages to read a term.If the end of the current input stream has been reached, then read(X) willcause X to be unified with the atom 'end_of_file'.  If the end of the streamwas reached on a previous input command, or if the end of the stream isencountered in the middle of reading a term, read/1 sends an error message tothe standard error stream and calls abort/0, returning to the top level.
