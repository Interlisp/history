ref-9-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 9-2: listing(+Predicate)If Predicate is an atom, then listing/1 lists the interpreted procedures forall predicates of that name, as for listing/0 ({manual(ref-9-1)}).  Theargument Predicate may also be a predicate specification of the form[Module:]Name/Arity, in which case only the clauses for the specified predicateare listed.  Finally, it is possible for Predicate to be a list of predicatespecifications and/or atoms; for example,             | ?- listing([concatenate/3, reverse, go/0]).Note that listing/1 does not work on compiled procedures unless they aredeclared to be dynamic.  If Predicate is neither an atom nor a predicatespecification (or list of predicate specifications) of the form[Module:]Name/Arity, listing/1 will simply fail.If you are running under the editor interface, there is a facility for findingthe source code definition for a specified compiled or interpreted procedureand reading it into an edit buffer.  This is likely to be more helpful thanlisting/1 in most cases.  See the Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide for moreinformation.
