ref-5-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 5-0: IntroductionProlog provides two classes of predicates for input and output:  those whichhandle individual characters, and those which handle complete Prolog terms.Input and output happen with respect to streams.  A stream can refer to a fileor to the user's terminal.  At any one time there is a current input stream anda current output stream.  Input and output predicates fall into threecategories:     1. those which use the current input or output stream;   2. those which use the standard input or output stream -- these      generally refer to the user's terminal; and   3. those which take an explicit stream argument.  Initially, the current input and output streams both refer to the user'sterminal, but there are predicates which allow you to change them when you wantto read from, or write to, a file.Xerox Quintus Prolog differs from DEC-10 Prolog and some other Prolog systemsin that the Xerox Quintus Prolog top level always refers to the standard inputand output streams rather than to the current input and output streams.Therefore, if you set the current output stream to a certain file and forget toclose the file, you will not suddenly find all your '| ?- ' prompts being sentto that file (and nothing to the terminal).
