ref-5-3-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                        Section 5-3-3: Stream ObjectsEach input and output stream is represented by a unique Prolog term.  Ingeneral, this term is of the form            '$stream'(X, Y).where X and Y are positive integers.  In addition, the following terms are usedto identify the standard I/O streams:            user_input            user_output            user_errorStream objects are created by the predicate open/3 ({manual(ref-5-3-4)}) andpassed as arguments to those predicates which need them.  Representation forstream objects to be used in C code is different.  Use stream_code/2 (describedin the system-dependent features manual for machines on which it exists) toconvert from one to the other when appropriate.
