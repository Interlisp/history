ref-8-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 8-3: ?T1 \== ?T2T1 \== T2 succeeds if the terms currently instantiating T1 and T2 are notliterally identical.  For example, the query             | ?- T1 \== T2.succeeds because T1 and T2 are distinct uninstantiated variables.  However, thequery             | ?- T1 = T2, T1 \== T2.fails because the first goal unifies the two variables.'\=='/2 has no associated error conditions.
