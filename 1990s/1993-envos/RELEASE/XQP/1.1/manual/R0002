ref-0-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 0-2: Predicate SpecificationsA number of Xerox Quintus Prolog predicates take a predicate specification asan argument.  A predicate specification is a term of the form Name, Name/Arity,Module:Name, or Module:Name/Arity, where Module and Name are atoms, and Arityis an integer.  If Arity is omitted, then the term applies to predicates withany arity.  If Module is omitted, then the term applies to predicates in thecurrent module.  Additionally, a set of predicates with the same name butdifferent arities can be referred to by a predicate specification of the formName/[Arity1,...ArityN].  For more information, see {manual(ref-2-1-1)}.
