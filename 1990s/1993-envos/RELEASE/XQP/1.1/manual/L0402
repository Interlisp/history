lib-4-2                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                 Section 4-2: The "is-not-provable" OperatorDEC-10 Prolog, C-Prolog, and Quintus Prolog all provide an "is-not-provable"operator '\+'.  The meaning of            \+ Goalis that the Prolog system is unable to find any solution for Goal as itcurrently stands.In operational terms, we have            \+ Goal :-                ( call(Goal) -> fail                ; true                ).In DEC-10 Prolog and C-Prolog, this is exactly how \+ is implemented.  InQuintus Prolog there is a slight difference:  the Quintus Prolog compilersupports "(if -> then ; else)" directly, so a clause of the form            p :-                 q,                 \+ r,                 s.is compiled as if you had written            p :-                 q,                 ( r -> fail ; true ),                 s.If '\+' were not known to the compiler, the form "r" would be built as a datastructure and passed to \+ to interpret, which would be slower and wouldrequire more memory.  The extra efficiency of having '\+' handled directly bythe compiler is well worth having.
