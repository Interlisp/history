sysdep-3-1-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                          Section 3-1-1: statisticsstatistics/0 displays on the terminal statistics relating to memory usage,garbage collection, and run time, including information about which areas ofmemory have overflowed and how much time has been spent expanding them.The output from statistics/0 looks like this:memory (total)       426712 bytes   program space     287280 bytes:   261848 in use,    25432 free   global space        6664 bytes:     3036 in use,     3628 free      global stack                     3020 bytes      trail                              16 bytes   local stack         5532 bytes:     1592 in use,     3940 free 0.0 sec. for 0 program, 0 global and 0 local space overflows 0.000 sec. for 0 garbage collections which collected 0 bytes 0.583 sec. runtimeNote the use of indentation to indicate sub-areas.  That is, memory containsthe program space, global space, and local stack, and the global space containsthe global stack and trail.The garbage collection statistics are initialized to zero when a Prolog sessionstarts (this includes starting Xerox Quintus Prolog from the Xerox QuintusProlog menu item as well as from the "start new prolog" subitem).See statistics/2 below for how to obtain individual statistics.
