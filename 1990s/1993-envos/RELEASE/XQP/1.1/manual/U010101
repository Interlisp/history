For example,            If it is cold and it is raining,                    then I should drive to work.is a Horn clause, whereas            If it is cold and it is raining,                   then either I will drive to work                        or I will get my feet wet.is not, because it has two possible conclusions ("I will drive to work" and "Iwill get my feet wet").The fact            It is cold.is also a Horn clause; it can be viewed as being equivalent to the (trivial)rule of inference            If true is true, then it is cold.Prolog is a language in which programs are written to answer such questions as"Should I drive to work today?" using rules and facts like the Horn clausesabove.  To facilitate the answering of such questions, rules in Prolog arewritten with their conclusions first, as in            I should drive to work if                    it is cold and                    it is raining.When written this way, the conclusion is also known as the head of the rule,and the premises are known as the body.
