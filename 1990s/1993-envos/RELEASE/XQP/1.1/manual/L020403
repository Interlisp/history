lib-2-4-3                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                  Section 2-4-3: memberchk(+Element, +List)In the previous section, it was pointed out that member(e, [s,e,e,n]) succeedstwice.  If you have a ground term (or one which is sufficiently instantiated)and you only want to know whether it occurs in a list or not, you would likethe membership test to succeed only once.  memberchk/2 is a version of member/2that does this.memberchk(Element, List) can only be used to test whether a known elementoccurs in a known list.  It cannot be used to enumerate elements of the list.memberchk/2 commits to the first match and does not backtrack.Use memberchk/2 in preference to member/2, but only where its restrictions areappropriate.
