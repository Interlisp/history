ref-5-3-15                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual        Section 5-3-15: absolute_file_name(+RelFileSpec, -AbsFileSpec)If RelFileSpec is bound to a valid file name, then AbsFileSpec will be unifiedwith the absolute name of the file.  If RelFileSpec is the basename of a filewith a ".pl" suffix, then AbsFileSpec is unified with the absolute name of thefile with the ".pl" suffix; otherwise, it is unified with the absolute namewithout the ".pl" suffix.The RelFileName 'user' is a special case.  AbsFileName will be bound to 'user',even when a file 'user.pl' exists.  The special treatment given to 'user' byabsolute_file_name/2 exactly parallels the special treatment given that "filename" by compile/1, consult/1, and [_|_].  Note that consult/1({manual(ref-3-1-1)}), compile/1 ({manual(ref-3-1-2)}), andabsolute_file_name/2 all resolve file names in exactly the same way.If either RelFileSpec or AbsFileSpec is a syntactically incorrect file name,absolute_file_name/2 fails, sends an error message to the standard errorstream; the system then enters the debugger in trace mode.For more information, see the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependent FeaturesManual.
