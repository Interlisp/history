ref-3-6-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                  Section 3-6-1: library_directory(?DirSpec)library_directory/1 is a predicate which may be defined by the user in order tospecify a set of file system directories which are to be searched when a filespecification of the form library(Name) is used. The directories are searchedin the order in which they are returned by library_directory/1 until Name.pl orName is found.The default clauses for library_directory/1 in the Prolog system can be seen bycalling listing/[0,1].  To specify an additional directory to be searchedbefore the default ones, add a goal of the form            :- asserta(library_directory((DirSpec))).to your prolog.ini file.  See the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependentFeatures Manual for a description of prolog.ini files.
