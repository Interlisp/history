lib-6-1                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                          Section 6-1: IntroductionXerox Quintus Prolog, DEC-10 Prolog, C-Prolog, and other similar Prolog systemsoffer only two methods of input:   1. reading Prolog terms using read/1   2. reading single characters using get0/1There is a large gap between the two, and sometimes the input requirements ofapplication programs lies in the gap.  The Prolog library contains two sets ofpackages to fill the gap.   - library(read_in) and library(read_sent) are for reading English     sentences.  They return a list of words, which you can then parse     using a Definite Clause Grammar (built into the Prolog system).   - library(ctypes), library(prompt), library(read_const),     library(continued), library(lineio), and library(ask) are more     general in purpose.
