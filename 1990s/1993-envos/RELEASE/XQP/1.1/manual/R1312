ref-13-12                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                         Section 13-12: Name ClashesA name clash can arise if:   1. a module tries to import a predicate from some other module m1 and      it has already imported a predicate with the same name and arity      from a module m2;   2. a module tries to import a predicate from some other module m1 and      it already contains a definition of a predicate with the same name      and arity; or   3. a module tries to define a predicate with the same name and arity as      one that it has imported.Whenever a name clash arises, a message is displayed which begins with thewords "NAME CLASH".  If the module that is importing or defining the clashingpredicate is not 'user', then this message is just a warning, and the attemptto import or define the predicate simply fails.  Following this message, if themodule is 'user', the user is asked to choose from one of three options; forexample,NAME CLASH: f/3 is already imported into module user            from module m1;            do you want to override this definition with            the one in m2? (y, n, p, or ?)The meanings of the four recognized replies are as follows:   - "y" means forget the previous definition of f/3 from m1 and use the     new definition of f/3 from m2 instead.   - "n" means retain the previous definition of f/3 from m1 and ignore     the new definition of f/3 from m2.   - "p" (for proceed) means forget the previous definition of f/3 and of     all subsequent predicate definitions in m1 which clash during the     current load of m2.  Instead, use the new definitions in m2.  When     the "p" option is chosen, predicates being loaded from m1 into m2     will cause no "NAME CLASH" messages for the remainder of the load,     though clashes with predicates from other modules will still generate     such messages.   - "?" gives brief help information.
