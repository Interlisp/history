user-3-3-3                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide       Section 3-3-3: Accessing the Help System Using Prolog PredicatesThe on-line help system can also be accessed through the use of the followingfour Prolog predicates: help/0, help/1, manual/0, and manual/1.  The help/0predicate prints information to the Prolog output stream, while the other threepredicates all work by activating the XQPInfo system described above.Typing            help.displays basic information, such as how to start using the help system and howto exit from Prolog.  Typing            manual.gives you a display of the top level of the manual hierarchy, showing the listof manuals.  As described on {manual(user-3-3)}, left-mousing one of the manualtitles will automatically show the chapter titles of that manual.Supplying a chapter (or section or subsection) number, as in            manual(2)will cause XQPInfo to display that particular point in the manual hierarchy.At this point, proceed as described above.
