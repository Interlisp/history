sysdep-2-6            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual              Section 2-6: Calling Prolog with Top Level ActiveIt is sometimes possible to call PROLOG when the Prolog top-level is running.If the active Prolog top-level is waiting for user input at the top levelprompt (| ?-), or at the debugger prompt, the user may call the PROLOGfunction.  The lisp function (PROLOG.IS.READY) returns a non-NIL value if it ispossible to call PROLOG at that moment.  It returns T if no Prolog process iscurrently active, or the Lisp process in which the Prolog top-level is runningbut it is possible to call PROLOG anyway.
