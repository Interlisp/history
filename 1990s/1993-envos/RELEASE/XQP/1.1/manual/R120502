ref-12-5-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 12-5-2: Printing Optionsp       print        This option prints the current goal using print/1 ({manual(ref-6-1-6)})        and the current debugger print depth limit.  The depth limit prevents        very large structures from being shown in their entirety; it can be        changed with the '<' option (see below).w       write        This option writes the current goal on the terminal using write/1        @see[write#1]).  This may be useful if your "pretty print" routine        (portray/1) is not doing what you want.  The 'write' option has no        depth limit.d       display        This option displays the current goal on the terminal using display/1        ({manual(ref-6-1-5)}).  This shows the goal in prefix notation.  The        'display' option has no depth limit.g       ancestors        This option prints the list of ancestors of the current goal (that is,        all goals that are between the current goal and the top-level goal in        the calling sequence).  This uses the ancestors/1 built-in predicate        (see {manual(ref-11-5)}).  Each ancestor goal is printed using print/1        with the current debugger depth limit.  Goals shown in the ancestor        list are always accessible to invocations for the 'r' (retry) option        unless they are marked '(-)'.  Ancestors marked '(-)' were invoked        before the debugger was turned on and have not had debugging        information retained for them.g <n>   ancestors        This is a version of the 'g' option which prints only <n> ancestors.        That is, the last <n> ancestors will be printed counting back from the        current goal.< <n>   set depth        This option sets the debugger print depth limit to <n>.  This limit        determines the depth to which goals are printed when they are shown by        the debugger.  The depth limit is also used when showing the ancestor        list.  If <n> is 0, or is omitted, the debugger will then use no limit        when printing goals.  The initial limit is 10.
