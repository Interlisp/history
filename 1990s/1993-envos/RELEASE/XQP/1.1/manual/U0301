Interpreted code loads more quickly than compiled code and is easierto debug.  Compiled code runs more quickly than interpreted code; but since itis more difficult to debug, you will usually compile programs only after theyare thoroughly debugged.  You can freely mix interpreted and compiled code, soyou might often find it convenient to compile portions of your programs thathave been debugged, and to interpret portions that you are still working on.To interpret programs, use the consult/1 predicate (see {manual(user-3-3)}); tocompile programs, use the compile/1 predicate (see {manual(user-3-3)}).  Underthe TEdit/Prolog interface, you will often find it easier to load programsthrough TEdit, as described below.  By using TEdit, you can mark a region,invoke the interpreter or compiler from within TEdit, and load the markedregion.
