ref-8-11-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                Section 8-11-2: number_chars(?Number, ?Chars)Chars is the list of ASCII character codes comprising the printedrepresentation of Number.  number_chars(Number, Chars) is a relation between anumber Number and a list Chars consisting of the ASCII character codescomprising the printed representation of Number.  Initially, either Number mustbe instantiated to a number, or Chars must be instantiated to a proper list ofcharacter codes (containing no variables).If Number is initially instantiated to a number, Chars will be unified with thelist of character codes that make up its printed representation.  If Number isuninstantiated and Chars is initially instantiated to a list of characters thatcorresponds to the correct syntax of a number (either integer or float), Numberwill be bound to that number; otherwise number_chars/2 will simply fail.  Ifthe arguments to number_chars/2 are both uninstantiated, number_chars/2 willfail, and an error message will be sent to the standard error stream.  Thesystem will then enter the debugger in trace mode.Here are some examples of the use of number_chars/2:              | ?- number_chars(foo, L).            no            | ?- number_chars(431, L).            L = [52,51,49]            | ?- number_chars(X, [102,111,111]).            no            | ?- number_chars(X, [52,51,49]).            X = 431            | ?- number_chars(X, "15.0e+12").            X = 1.5e+13
