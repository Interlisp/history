ref-9-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                 Section 9-4: current_predicate(?Name, ?Term)current_predicate(Name, Term) unifies Name with the name of a user-definedpredicate, and Term with the most general term corresponding to that predicate.For example, if you have a foo/1 and a foo/3 in your program,current_predicate/2 would return the following:              | ?- current_predicate(foo, T).            T = foo(_116) ;            T = foo(_116,_117,_118) ;            noThe goal             | ?- current_predicate(Name, Term).can be used to backtrack through every predicate in your program.current_predicate/2 only succeeds for those predicates which are defined in amodule.  It fails for those predicates which are imported into a module.            | ?- current_predicate(_, m:P).will backtrack through all predicates P which are defined in module m.  Tobacktrack through all predicates imported by a module use predicate_property/2({manual(ref-9-5)}).
