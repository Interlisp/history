ref-10-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                             Section 10-4: abortabort/0 abandons the current execution and returns to the top level.  All breaklevels (suspended execution states created by break/0) are destroyed.  This isa fairly drastic predicate and is normally only used when some error conditionhas occurred and there is no way of carrying on, or when debugging.The abort facility is often used via the debugging option 'a' and also via theControl-c interrupt option 'a'.Beware of the fact that abort/0 does not close any files which you may haveopened.  If you are doing file manipulation using see/1 and tell/1, (ratherthan open/3, set_input/1, and set_output/1), then strange behavior may occurafter your program is aborted and restarted, unless you remember to close thefiles yourself.abort/0 has no associated error conditions.
