ref-19-4-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 19-4-0: OverviewIn Xerox Quintus Prolog, procedures are indexed on their first arguments.  Thismeans that when a procedure is called with an instantiated first argument, ahash table is used to gain fast access to only those clauses having a firstargument with the same primary functor as the one in the procedure call.  Ifthe first argument is atomic, only clauses with a matching first argument areaccessed.  Indexes are maintained automatically by the built-in predicatesmanipulating the Prolog data base (for example, assert/1, retract/1, consult/1,and compile/1).Keeping this feature in mind when writing programs can help speed theirexecution.  Some hints for program structuring that will best use the indexingfacility are given below.Note that as of Release 2.0 of Xerox Quintus Prolog, interpreted procedures aswell as compiled procedures are indexed.  The programming hints given in thissection apply equally to compiled and interpreted code.
