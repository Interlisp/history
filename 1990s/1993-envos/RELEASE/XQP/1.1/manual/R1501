ref-15-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                   Section 15-1: recorda(+Key, ?Term, -Ref)recorda(Key, Term, Ref) records the Term in the internal data base as the firstitem for the key Key; a data base reference to the newly-recorded term isreturned in Ref.  If Key is a compound term, only its principal functor issignificant.  That is, foo(1) represents the same key as foo(n).If Key is not instantiated, or is instantiated to a float, recorda/3 fails andan error message is sent to the standard error stream.  The system then entersthe debugger in trace mode.
