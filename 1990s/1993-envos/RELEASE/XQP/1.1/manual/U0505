user-5-5                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide             Section 5-5: Error Messages for Built-in PredicatesIf your program calls a built-in predicate with arguments that are notappropriate for that predicate, the system may display an error message.  Afterthe message is displayed, one of three things happens, depending upon theseverity of the error.  The predicate succeeds, it fails, or it causes theprogram to be aborted.  An example of each type of error message is shownbelow.  See the Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual for more detailedinformation.If your program contained the following goal:            | ?- op(-1, xfx, foo).the following message would be displayed:[ERROR: op(-1,xfx,foo) - precedence -1 is not 0..1200 (error 321)]However, the goal would still succeed.If your program contained the goal 'X is Y', and Y were uninstantiated at thetime the goal was called, and the program were running under the interpreter,the error messages shown below would be displayed, and the goal would fail.| ?- X is Y.[ERROR: variable is not bound to a number: _97 (error 303)][ERROR: invalid arithmetic expression: _97 (error 302)]If the goal 'save(foo).' were called and the file foo were protected, thesystem would display the error message shown below and abort the program.| ?- save(foo).[ ERROR: no permission to access file '/usr/ufs/foo' (error 106)][ Execution aborted ]
