ref-5-6-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 5-6-1: see(+S)see(S) makes file S the current input stream.  If S is an atom, it is taken tobe a file name, and   - if there is an open input stream associated with the file name, and     that stream was opened by see/1, then it is made the current input     stream;   - Otherwise, the specified file is opened for input and made the     current input stream.  If it is not possible to open the file, see/1     fails.  In addition, if the 'fileerrors' flag is set (as it is by     default), see/1 sends an error message to the standard error stream     and calls abort/0, returning to the top level.If S is a stream object and open for input, then it is made the current inputstream.  If the stream is not currently open for input, or if S is neither astream object nor an atom, then see/1 fails and sends an error message to thestandard error stream.  The system then enters the debugger in trace mode.Different file names (that is, names which do not unify) represent differentstreams (even if different file names correspond to the same file).  Therefore,assuming 'food' and './food' represent the same file, the sequence            see(food)            ...            see('./food')will open two streams, both connected to the same file.It is important to remember to close streams when you have finished with them.Use seen/0 or close/1.
