user-6-1                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                     Section 6-1: Background InformationThe debugger can trace program execution at four key points:   - procedure entry, when a solution to a goal is first looked for   - procedure exit, when a solution to a goal is found   - procedure reentry, when an alternative solution is looked for, and a     procedure is reentered during backtracking   - procedure failure, when no (more) solutions are found for a goal, and     the procedure is finally exited.As the debugger proceeds through each step of the execution of a procedure, itdisplays a message letting you know which of these four points it is currentlypassing through. These entry and exit points are called ports, and they arereferred to by the debugger as follows:    Port    Description    Call    Look for a solution to the goal    Exit    Exit because a solution has been found    Redo    Look for alternative solutions (backtrack)    Fail    Exit because there are no (more) solutions
