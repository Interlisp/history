ref-5-6-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 5-6-4: tell(+S)tell(S) makes S the current output stream.   - if there is an open output stream currently associated with the file     name, and that stream was opened by tell/1, then it is made the     current output stream;   - Otherwise, the specified file is opened for output and made the     current output stream.  If the file does not exist, it is created.     If it is not possible to open the file (because of protections, for     example), tell/1 fails.  In addition, if the 'fileerrors' flag is set     (which it is by default), tell/1 sends an error message to the     standard error stream and calls abort/0, returning to the top level.If S is not a stream or an atom, tell(S) fails, and sends an error message tothe standard error stream; the system then enters the debugger in trace mode.Different file names (names which do not unify) represent different streams(even if the different file names correspond to the same file). Therefore,assuming 'food' and './food' represent the same file, the sequence            tell(food)            ...            tell('./food')will open two streams, both connected to the same file.It is important to remember to close streams when you have finished with them.Use told/0 ({manual(ref-5-6-6)}) or close/1 ({manual(ref-5-3-6)}).
