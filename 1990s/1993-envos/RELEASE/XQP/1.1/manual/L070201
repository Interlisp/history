lib-7-2-1                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                     Section 7-2-1: On-line DocumentationThe 'library' directory contains two files which describe the contents of thedirectory.  They are called Contents and Index.The Index file contains one line for each exported predicate in the library.The predicates are listed in standard order, ignoring module names.  A typicalentry looks like this:            list_to_binary/4   flatten   ./flatten.plThis means that there is a predicate called list_to_binary/4 in the library,that it lives in a module called 'flatten', and that the file which contains itis 'flatten.pl' in the same directory as the Index.You can inspect the Index and Contents files with the text editor of yourchoice.The Contents file is organized by library files rather than by predicates.  Atypical entry in this file is a block of lines like this:basics  + is supportedbasics  % the basic list processing predicatesbasics  - ./basics.plbasics  : append/3basics  : member/2basics  : memberchk/2basics  : nonmember/2The first line means that library(basics) is part of the supported library.The second line is a short description of the contents.  The third line sayswhich file contains library(basics); in this case it is 'basics.pl' in the samedirectory as Contents.  The remaining lines list the predicates exported bylibrary(basics).  You could obtain this information by issuing the UNIX command            % egrep '^basics' $QL/ContentsThese files are provided as a convenience, and do not have the same authorityas the printed manual.
