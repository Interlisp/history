ref-11-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 11-0: IntroductionThis chapter explains the debugging facilities that are available in XeroxQuintus Prolog.  The main features of the debugging package are:     - The "procedure box" control flow model of Prolog execution, which     provides a simple way of visualizing control flow, especially during     backtracking.  Control flow is viewed at the procedure level, rather     than at the level of individual clauses.   - The ability to exhaustively trace your program or to selectively set     spypoints.  Spypoints allow you to specify procedures where the     program is to pause so that you can interact.   - A wide choice of control and information options available during     debugging.
