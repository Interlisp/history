In some applications it may bedesirable to invoke the garbage collector at regular intervals (when there isknown to be a significant amount of garbage on the heap) so that the time spentgarbage collecting is more evenly distributed in the processing time.  Forinstance, it may prove desirable to invoke the garbage collector after eachiteration of a question-and-answer loop which is not failure-driven.
