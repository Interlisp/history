ref-1-1-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 1-1-1: IntegersThe printed form of an integer consists of a sequence of digits optionallypreceded by a minus sign (-).  These are normally interpreted as base 10integers.  It is also possible to enter integers in other bases (1 through 36);this is done by preceding the digit string by the base (in decimal) followed byan apostrophe.  If a base greater than 10 is used, the characters A-Z or a-zare used to stand for digits greater than 9.  Examples of valid integerrepresentations are:            1   -2345   85923   8'777   16'3F4A   -12'2A9Note that            +525is not a valid integer.A base of zero will return the ASCII code of the (single) character after thequote; for example,             0'a = 97
