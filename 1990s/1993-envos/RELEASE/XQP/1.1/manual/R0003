ref-0-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 0-3: System-dependent FeaturesThis reference manual describes all the features of Xerox Quintus Prolog thatare common to all implementations of the system.  However, certain features ofthe Xerox Quintus Prolog development environment vary from system to system.These features are described in the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependentFeatures Manual.  Included in that manual is information about:   - Sending an end-of-file character to Prolog   - Ways of invoking Prolog   - Incrementally interpreting or compiling code through the editor     interface   - Executing operating system commands from within Prolog -- unix/1,     vms/1, lisp_apply/3   - Using the foreign function interface -- foreign/[2,3],     foreign_file/2, and load_foreign_files/2 for UNIX and VMS systems;     lisp_apply/3 and lisp_predicate/2 for Xerox systems   - Memory use -- gc/0, nogc/0, statistics/[0,2], trimcore/0,     garbage_collect/0   - Comparison of Xerox Quintus Prolog and DEC-10 Prolog   - Limits on floating-point and fixed-point numbers   - Limits in Xerox Quintus Prolog   - Terminal Requirements
