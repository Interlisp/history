ref-6-5-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                  Section 6-5-3: line_position(+Stream, -N)line_position(Stream, N) unifies N with the total number of characters eitherread or written on the current line of the open stream Stream.  A fresh linehas a line position of 0.  See {manual(ref-6-5-4)}, for details on the use ofthis predicate on a stream which is directed to the user's terminal.If the Stream argument does not specify an open stream, thenline_position(Stream, N) sends an error message to the standard error stream,and aborts.  If N is instantiated to a non-integer, the predicate fails with a"bad argument" error message and begins tracing.
