ref-6-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 6-0: OverviewIn Prolog, arithmetic is performed by certain built-in predicates which takearithmetic expressions as their arguments and evaluate them.  Arithmeticexpressions can evaluate to integers or floating-point numbers (floats).  Forinformation on acceptable ranges of integers and floating-point numbers, and onthe effective precision of compiled and interpreted arithmetic, see the XeroxQuintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual.
