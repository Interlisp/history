ref-5-1-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 5-1-3: writeq(?X)writeq(X) writes the term X to the current output stream.  This is the same aswrite(X) except that, when necessary, single quotes are put around atoms andfunctors to make them acceptable as input to read/[1,2].Note that writeq/1 does not terminate its output with a full-stop.  Therefore,if you want this term to be input to read/[1,2], you must explicitly write afull-stop to mark the end of the term.Like write/1, writeq/1 treats terms of the form '$VAR'(N) specially; it writes'A' if N=0, 'B' if N=1, ...'Z' if N=25, 'A1' if N=26, etc.  Terms of this formare generated by numbervars/3 (see {manual(ref-7-12)}).writeq/1 always succeeds without error.
