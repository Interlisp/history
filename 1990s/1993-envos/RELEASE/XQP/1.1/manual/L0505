lib-5-5                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual        Section 5-5: library(fbprolog) -- Prolog and the File BrowserThe Lisp library includes a very useful utility called the File Browser.  Thispresents a scrolling display of files matching a certain pattern, with a menuallowing various operations on selected files.  These operations includeloading or compiling lisp files, but nothing for Prolog code.  This packageadds a Prolog menu item to the file browser, allowing users to compile Prologfiles by selecting them in the file broswer display, and then selecting theProlog item in the file browser menu.  A submenu under the Prolog item offersthe choice of consulting the Prolog files.  For more information about the FileBrowser, see the Xerox Lisp Library Modules manual.There is actually no Prolog code used to implement this package; all code is inthe Lisp file FBPROLOG, which library(fbprolog) loads.  The library includesthe source code of FBPROLOG, to serve as an example of Lisp code that callsProlog.Since this package includes no Prolog code at all, the file FBPROLOG can beloaded directly from Lisp.  Thus some users might want to copy the compiledversion of this file (FBPROLOG.DFASL) to a directory that is on their list ofLisp library and user package directories (LISPUSERSDIRECTORIES).  Then thispackage could be loaded directly from Lisp with the command (FILESLOAD (SYSLOAD FROM VALUEOFLISPUSERSDIRECTORIES) FBPROLOG)
