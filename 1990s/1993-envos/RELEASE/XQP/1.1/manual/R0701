ref-7-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                             Section 7-1: var(?X)var(X) succeeds if X is currently uninstantiated ('var' is short for variable);otherwise it fails.  An uninstantiated variable is one which has not been boundto anything, except possibly another uninstantiated variable.  Note that acompound term with some arguments which are uninstantiated is not itselfconsidered to be uninstantiated.  Examples:              | ?- var(foo(X,Y)).            no            | ?- var([X,Y]).            no            | ?- var(X).            yesvar/1 has no associated error conditions.
