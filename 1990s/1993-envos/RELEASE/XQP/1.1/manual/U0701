user-7-1                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide               Section 7-1: Porting From Other Quintus PrologsMost Quintus Prolog programs should port to Xerox Quintus Prolog with little orno effort.  Implementation differences lie mainly in the area of the foreignprocedure interface.  The mechanism provided under UNIX, VMS, and Aegis hasbeen replaced in Xerox Quintus Prolog by the lisp_predicate/2 and lisp_apply/3predicates, which work on different principles.  Calls to operating systemcommand primitives (for example, unix/1, vms/1), should also be replaced withappropriate lisp_apply/3 forms.Xerox Quintus Prolog does not implement saved states.  Thus, any calls tosave/[1,2] or save_program/1 must be removed.Integer arithmetic under Xerox Quintus Prolog is more general than under otherQuintus Prologs.  Under other implementations, integers are computed to finiteprecision (approximately 30 binary digits).  Integers under Xerox QuintusProlog are true infinite-precision integers.  It is possible, though unusual,for a program to depend on this precision.
