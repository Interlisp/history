sysdep-4-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual             Section 4-1: Prolog Layout Restrictions Under TEditThere are some restrictions on program layout which are necessary for the TEditConsult, Compile, and Find Definition commands to work properly.  They are:   1. Group clauses of the same name and arity together.  That is, do not      intersperse clauses of one procedure with clauses of another.      Normally, breaching this restriction will cause a style warning (see      the Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual).   2. Start the head of each clause at the beginning of a line, that is,      right up against the left-hand side of your window or screen.      Indent any continuation lines for that clause.   3. If you use multiple-line comments, indent all the continuation      lines.   4. If you are defining clauses for a predicate which is an operator, do      not use the operator property of the predicate when writing the head      of the clause.  For example, if you want to define clauses for      '+'/2, write the head of the clause in the form "+(A, B") and not      "A + B".
