lib-2-9                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                  Section 2-9: Unification -- library(unify)This file defines only one predicate.unify(?Term1, ?Term2)            is true when Term1 unifies with Term2.  The only difference between            this predicate and the built-in predicate Term1 = Term2 is that            unify/2 applies the "occur check" and the built-in predicate '='/2            does not.  This means that according to ordinary logic, a variable            X should not unify with a term containing X. unify/2 does this            correctly and '='/2 does not.  Thus            | ?- unify(X, [X]).            no            | ?- X = [X].            X = [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[...            Whenever unify(X, Y) succeeds, X = Y would have succeeded and made            the same variable bindings.
