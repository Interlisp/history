sysdep-6-1-2            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                        Section 6-1-2: Display TogglesThe Display toggles control what will be displayed when a node is visited.Graph                                                     [XQPInfo Menu Toggle]            When the Graph toggle is activated, the hierarchical organization            of the manuals as a graph of a tree structure is displayed, with            the current location highlighted.  Selecting a node in this display            will visit the corresponding node in the graph and update the            current location.  This method of access provides information about            the organization of the manuals, even when the current node in the            tree has no text associated with it.Menu                                                      [XQPInfo Menu Toggle]            When the Menu toggle is activated, a menu of subnodes of the            current node is displayed.  If the current node has no subnodes, no            menu will be displayed.  Selecting an item in the subnode menu will            visit that node in the graph.Text                                                      [XQPInfo Menu Toggle]            When the Text toggle is activated (the default), the text window            below the Expanded Menu window is opened.  Note that not all            positions in the graph have text associated with them; for nodes            that have none, the message "This node has no text" will be            displayed.  Turning off the Text toggle will speed up the visiting            of nodes considerably; this can be useful when searching for a            particular node.History                                                   [XQPInfo Menu Toggle]            When the History toggle is activated, a menu containing the history            of nodes visited is displayed.  Selecting an item from this menu            will revisit selected node.
