ref-11-3-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                Section 11-3-3: Debugging Selected ProceduresTo debug a selected procedure, you set a spypoint on that procedure, using thespy/1 predicate described in {manual(ref-11-6-6)}.  When control passes throughany port of a procedure with a spypoint set on it, the debugger displays thegoal the system is currently trying to satisfy and then prompts you for input.Spypoints can be set and removed at any time; it is often useful to add furtherspypoints during the course of a debugging session.
