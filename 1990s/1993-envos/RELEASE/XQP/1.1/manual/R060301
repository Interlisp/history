The goal succeeds if theresults are equal.  For example,            | ?- 1.0 + 1.0 =:= 2.            yes            | ?- "a" =:= 97.            yesIf X and Y are not arithmetic expressions, or if X or Y contains variableswhich are not bound to numbers, an error message is sent to the standard errorstream, and the goal fails.
