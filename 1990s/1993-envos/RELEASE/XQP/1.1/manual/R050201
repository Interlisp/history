ref-5-2-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 5-2-1: get0(-N)get0(N) unifies N with the ASCII code of the next character from the currentinput stream.  If there are no more characters in the stream, N is unified with-1.  If the end of the stream was reached on a previous input command, thenget0/1 (pronounced "get-zero of one") will send an error message to thestandard error stream and call abort/0, returning to the top level.
