Atom must be an atomor a variable.  Char must be a character code or a variable.  Character codesare integers in the range 1..65535.If both arguments are uninstantiated, char_atom/2 fails, and an error messageis sent to the standard error stream.  If either argument is instantiated, butChar is not a valid character code or Atom is not an atom, char_atom/2 failssilently.If Char is a valid character code, Atom is unified with the atom whose name is[Char].If Atom is an atom, and its name contains a single character, Char is unifiedwith the code of that character.char_atom(Char, Atom) is true when Char is a character code, Atom is an atomwhose name contains exactly one character, and Code is the code of thatcharacter.  If Atom's name has no characters, or more than one, this predicateis simply false.  Error messages and efficiency aside, char_atom/2 could bedefined as            char_atom(Char, Atom) :-                    atom_chars(Atom, [Char]).
