ref-6-7-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 6-7-3: ttyskip(+N)ttyskip(N) skips over characters received from the terminal until the firstoccurrence of a character with ASCII code N.  The most useful form of integerexpression in this context is a single character in double quotes, for example,"a" which evaluates to 97, the ASCII code for the letter 'a'.If N is not a valid arithmetic expression, ttyskip(N) will fail, and an errormessage will be sent to the standard error stream.  If N is an unboundvariable, ttyskip(N) fails, and an error message is sent to the standard errorstream.  The system then enters the debugger in trace mode.
