ref-14-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                     Section 14-4: assertz(+Clause, -Ref)assertz(Clause, Ref) is equivalent to assertz(Clause) ({manual(ref-13-2-3)}),but returns in Ref a data base reference which uniquely identifies the newlyasserted Clause.On some systems, it is possible to guess reference numbers so as to instantiateRef to a value that will unify with the value returned by assertz/2, but thisis not recommended.  Ref should always be uninstantiated; assertz/2 fails ifRef does not unify with its return value.
