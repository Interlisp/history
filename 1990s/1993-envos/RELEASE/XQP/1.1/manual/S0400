sysdep-4-0            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                            Section 4-0: OverviewPerhaps the most interesting new features of Xerox Quintus Prolog are theinterfaces to TEdit and TExec.  These are invoked by selecting the Prologoption from the main background menu; this action brings up a TExec windowrunning Xerox Quintus Prolog.  You can open one or more TEdit windows for yourProlog source code and then move back and forth freely between these windows.This chapter discusses some of the features of the TEdit interface.  For moreinformation, see the Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide.
