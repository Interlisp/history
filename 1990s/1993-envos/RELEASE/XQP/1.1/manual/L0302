lib-3-2                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                          Section 3-2: Type Testingstring(+Constant)            is true when Constant is instantiated to a string.  It is just like            atom/1, except that it succeeds for strings and fails for atoms.  .            This predicate can only succeed in Xerox Quintus Prolog, because            that is currently the only version of Quintus Prolog to have a            separate string data type.name(+Constant)            is true when Constant is any kind of constant which has a unique            name.  Numbers do not have unique names:  "002" and "2" both            identify the number 2.  The constants which satisfy this test are            called named constants and also text objects.            In Xerox Quintus Prolog the named constants are atoms and strings.If your code needs to test whether some datum would be acceptable as anargument to one of the text-processing routines, you should use name/1 ratherthan atom/1.There is no Prolog form which designates a Lisp string, hence the Lisp call inthis example:            | ?- lisp_apply('MKSTRING', [fred], String),            |    string(String),        % succeeds            |    name(String),          % succeeds            |    name(fred),            % succeeds            |    string(fred).          % failsNote particularly:            | ?- string("chars").            no            | ?- name("chars").            no            | ?- name("").            yes            | ?- atom("").            yes
