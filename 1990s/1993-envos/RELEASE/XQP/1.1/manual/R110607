ref-11-6-7                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 11-6-7: nospy(+X)nospy(X) removes spypoints on all the predicates represented by X.  Thepossible forms for X are the same as for spy/1 ({manual(ref-11-6-6)}).To remove all spypoints, see nospyall/0 ({manual(ref-11-6-8)}).If nospy/1 is given any invalid argument, it fails and sends an error messageto the standard error stream.Note that since 'nospy' is a built-in operator, the parentheses which usuallysurround the arguments to a predicate are not necessary (although they can beused if desired).              | ?- nospy test/1.            [spypoint removed from test/1]            yes            | ?-
