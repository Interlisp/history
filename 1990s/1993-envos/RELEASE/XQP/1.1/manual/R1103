ref-11-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                             Section 11-3: breakbreak/0 causes the current execution to be interrupted and displays the message            [ Break level 1 ]            | ?-The system is then ready to accept input as though it were at top level.  Ifanother call to break/0 is encountered, it moves up to level 2, and so on.  Thebreak level is displayed in the editor mode line when you are running under theeditor interface; otherwise it is displayed on a separate line before eachtop-level prompt, as follows:              [1]            | ?-To close a break level and resume the execution which was suspended, type theend-of-file character applicable on your system.  break/0 then succeeds, andexecution of the interrupted program is resumed.  Alternatively, the suspendedexecution can be abandoned by calling the built-in predicate abort/0({manual(ref-11-4)}).break/0 has no associated error conditions.changes can be made to a running program while in a break level.  Any changemade to a procedure will take effect the next time that procedure is called.See {manual(ref-4-4)}, for details of what happens if a procedure that iscurrently being executed is redefined.  When a break level is entered, thedebugger is turned off (although leashing and spypoints are retained).  When abreak level is exited, the debugging state is restored to what it was beforethe break level was entered.The break facility is often used via the debugging option 'b'.
