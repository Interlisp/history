ref-10-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                      Section 10-1: Control-c InterruptsAt any time, Prolog's execution can be interrupted by typing Control-c.  Thefollowing prompt is then displayed:              Prolog interruption (h for help)?If you then type 'h', followed by Return, you will get a list of the possibleresponses to this prompt:              Prolog interrupt options:            c    continue - do nothing            t    trace    - debugger will start creeping            d    debug    - debugger will start leaping            a    abort    - cause a Prolog abort            e    exit     - irreversible exit from Prolog            h    help     - this listThe 'd' option will cause you to enter the debugger the next time controlpasses to a spypoint.  You can then use the 'g' (ancestors) option of thedebugger to find out at what level of execution you interrupted the program.The 't' option will also cause you to enter the debugger at spypoints, and willstop at the leashed ports of interpreted procedures as well.Neither option will help if you are stuck in a loop in compiled code which hasno spypoints set.  For this reason, you should be sure that your code isthoroughly debugged before compiling it.For more information on Control-c interrupts and signal handlers, see the XeroxQuintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual.
