user-3-3                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                 Section 3-3: Loading Programs without TEditIf you have created a Prolog program and stored it in a file, you can load thatfile into Prolog by selecting the Consult or Compile option of the TEdit menu,as described above, or you can load it from within the Prolog window, asdescribed below.NOTE:  We recommend that in most situations you load files by using either theConsult or Compile option of the TEdit menu; the consult/1 and compile/1predicates are best used only when you are certain that you do not need to edityour source code.When you consult or compile a file, Prolog adds the procedures defined in thefile to the Prolog data base, after first deleting any previous versions(either consulted or compiled) of those procedures from the data base.  (If theprocedures have been declared multifile, the previous versions of theprocedures are not deleted from the data base.  For more information onmultifile predicates, see the Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual.)You can consult a file in two ways:  you can type 'consult' followed by thename of the file containing the program at the main Prolog prompt, as shown inthe example below:            | ?- consult('myfile.pl').or, as a shorthand, you can type the name of the file enclosed in squarebrackets at the main Prolog prompt, as shown in the example below:              | ?- ['myfile.pl'].Note that in either case the command must be followed by a full-stop.  Thesingle quotes are necessary because the file name contains a non-alphanumericcharacter (.).  Usually, you can omit the '.pl' on files with that suffix; thisis one of the reasons that it is recommended that your Prolog file names end in'.pl'.  For example, you could simply type            | ?- [myfile].or            | ?- consult(myfile).Prolog would then look for a file called myfile.pl; if none existed, it wouldlook for one called myfile.To compile a program from within the Prolog environment, type 'compile'followed by the name of the file containing the program at the main Prologprompt, as shown in the example below.              | ?- compile(myfile).Remember that the command must be followed by a full-stop.When Prolog finishes consulting or compiling a file, it displays a message thatshows the name of the file that was loaded and the length of time it took toload the file.              [myfile.pl consulted (2.354 sec)]            | ?-As shown above, the main Prolog prompt reappears after the system finishesloading a file.  At this point, you can begin using your Prolog program, asdescribed in {manual(user-4)}.If you want to consult several files at once, enclose the list of file nameswithin square brackets, and separate the file names by commas.  For example, toconsult three files called file1.pl, file2.pl, and file3.pl, you would type            | ?- consult([file1,file2,file3]).Alternatively, you could type            | ?- [file1,file2,file3].If you want to compile several files at once, enclose the list of file nameswithin square brackets, and separate the file names by commas.  For example, tocompile three files called file1, file2, and file3, you would type             | ?- compile([file1,file2,file3]).
