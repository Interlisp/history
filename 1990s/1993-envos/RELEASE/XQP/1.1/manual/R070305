ref-7-3-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 7-3-5: +X =< +YX =< Y evaluates X and Y as arithmetic expressions.  The goal succeeds if theresult of evaluating X is less than or equal to the result of evaluating Y.If X and Y are not arithmetic expressions, or if X or Y contains variableswhich are not bound to numbers, an error message is sent to the standard errorstream, and the goal fails.Note that the symbol '=<' is used here rather than '<=' which is used in someother languages.  One way to remember this is that the inequality symbols inProlog are the ones which cannot be thought of as looking like arrows.  The '<'or '>' always points at the '='.              | ?- 42 =< 42.            yes            | ?- "b" =< "a".            no
