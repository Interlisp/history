ref-9-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                             Section 9-1: listinglisting/0 sends the clauses of all the interpreted procedures in the currentprogram to the current output stream.  You could list the entire interpretedprogram to a file using the command             | ?- tell(file), listing, told.Note that listing/0 does not work on compiled procedures unless they aredeclared to be dynamic.listing/1 ({manual(ref-9-2)}) is dependent on the source module.  As a specialcase,             | ?- listing(mod:_).will list all the interpreted predicates in module mod.  However, listing/0 isnot dependent on the source module; it refers instead to the type-in module.listing/0 has no associated error conditions.
