ref-11-8                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 11-8: depth(-D)depth(D) unifies D with the current depth; that is, the number of currentlyactive interpreted procedure calls.NOTE:  This predicate is only applicable to interpreted procedures.  Calls tocompiled procedures are not included in the depth and calls to interpreted codefrom compiled code start again from a depth of zero.If D is a term which cannot be unified with the current depth, depth(D) simplyfails.
