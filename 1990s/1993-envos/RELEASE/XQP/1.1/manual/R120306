ref-12-3-6                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 12-3-6: SummaryTo exhaustively trace a program, creep from one procedure port to the next.  Toselectively debug a program, set spypoints on selected procedures and then leapfrom spypoint to spypoint.  Note that leaping can be used to follow theprogram's execution at a higher level than exhaustive tracing through creeping.You can decide whether to creep or leap each time the debugger stops andprompts you for interaction.  This makes it easy to intermix these two options;for example, you can creep to see the start of a program, leap to a spypoint,creep a bit to follow the execution of a particular procedure, and then leap tothe next spypoint.NOTE:  When you first turn on the debugger, you direct it to start eithercreeping (trace mode) or leaping (debug mode) through each goal subsequentlytyped.  Note, however, that the trace/debug mode affects only the first goalthat is displayed.  Once the debugger has stopped and prompted you, you havecomplete control over what happens next.Another useful methodology for debugging is to use the skip option until someprocedure produces an unexpected result (or fails unexpectedly).  Then useretry to get back to the call of that procedure, creep once, and start skippingthrough the subgoals of the procedure.
