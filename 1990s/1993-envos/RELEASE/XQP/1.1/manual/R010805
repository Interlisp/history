ref-1-8-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                             Section 1-8-5: Notes   1. The expression of precedence 1000 (that is, belonging to syntactic      category term(1000)) which is written                   X, Y      denotes the term                   ','(X, Y)      in standard syntax.   2. The parenthesized expression (belonging to syntactic category      term(0))                   (X)      denotes simply the term X.   3. The curly-bracketed expression (belonging to syntactic category      term(0))                   {X}      denotes the term                   '{}'(X)      in standard syntax.   4. Note that, for example, "-3" denotes an integer, whereas "-(3)"      denotes a compound term of which the principal functor is '-'/1.   5. The double quote character '"' within a string must be written twice      for every time it is to appear in the string.  That is,                   """"      represents a string of one double quote character only.  Similarly,      for the single quote character within a quoted atom,                   ''''      represents an atom whose printed representation is one single quote      character.
