user-6-4                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                  Section 6-4: Debugging Compiled ProceduresThe Prolog debugger is normally used to debug interpreted procedures.  However,an interpreted program being debugged may have calls to procedures that arecompiled. The debugger will show the Calls to these procedures from interpretedclauses and the corresponding Fails or Exits.  However, the debugger does notshow any of the internal execution for calls to compiled procedures.Spypoints can be placed on both interpreted and compiled procedures.  Spypointson compiled procedures allow these procedures to be debugged even when they arecalled from other compiled procedures.  The debugger only retains depth andancestor information when spypoints are called from interpreted procedures.Spypoints on compiled procedures that have been called from other compiledprocedures do not retain this information.  This means that the 'g' optioncannot show any ancestors for such calls, and that the 'r' (retry) and 'f'(fail) options are more restricted.
