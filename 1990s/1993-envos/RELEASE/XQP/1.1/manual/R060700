ref-6-7-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 6-7-0: OverviewThe predicates listed below are similar to those described in{manual(ref-6-2)}, except that they always use the standard input and outputstreams, which normally refer to the user's terminal rather than to the currentinput stream or current output stream.Given stream-based input/output, these predicates are actually redundant.  Forexample, you could write get0(user, C) instead of ttyget0(C).
