lib-8-1-2                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                        Section 8-1-2: library(plint)Full documentation for 'plint' can be found in the text file tools/plint.doc.This utility takes a set of Prolog and C files, converts the foreign/3 facts inthe Prolog files to a C file which calls each of the foreign functions with thearguments that the foreign/3 fact says it should have, and then calls the UNIX'lint' command to check that this C file is consistent with the other C files(and, of course, that the other C files are consistent with each other).'plint' is indispensible for debugging the foreign interface.
