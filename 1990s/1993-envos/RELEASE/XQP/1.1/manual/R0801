The standardtotal order is:  variables @< numbers @< atoms @< compound terms.  Within thesecategories, ordering is as follows.     - Variables are put in a standard order.  (Roughly, the oldest variable     is put first; the order is not related to the names of variables.)   - Numbers are put in numeric order.  Where a number may be represented     by an integer or a floating-point number, as in 2 and 2.0, the     integer is considered to be infinitesimally smaller than its     floating-point counterpart.   - Atoms are put in alphabetical order according to the character set in     use.   - Compound terms are ordered first by arity, then by the name of the     principal functor, then by the arguments (in left-to-right order).   - Lists are compared as ordinary compound terms with functor '.'/2 For example, here is a list of terms in the standard order:[ X, -9, 1, 1.0, fie, foe, fum, [1], X = Y, fie(0,2), fie(1,1) ]The predicates for comparison of terms are described below.
