sysdep-3-3-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                  Section 3-3-1: prolog_flag(gc, -Old, ?New)'gc' is a boolean flag which enables and disables garbage collection.  Thevariables Old and New are used to access and change the value of 'gc', and canhave the values 'on' or 'off'.  'gc' is 'on' by default.  When it is 'on', thegarbage collector is enabled; subsequent heap overflows may trigger garbagecollection.  When it is 'off', the garbage collector is disabled; allsubsequent heap overflows will cause a system error.If Old or New is instantiated to any value other than 'off' or 'on',prolog_flag/3 fails, and an error message is sent to the standard error stream.The system then enters the debugger in trace mode.
