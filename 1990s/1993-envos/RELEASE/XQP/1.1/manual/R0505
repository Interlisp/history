ref-5-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                              Section 5-5: \+ +PThis fails if the goal P has a solution, and succeeds otherwise.  This is notreal negation ("P is false"), which is not possible in Prolog, butnegation-by-failure meaning "P is not provable".  P may not contain a cut.  Thegoal \+ P behaves exactly like             ( P -> fail ; true)Remember that with prefix operators such as this one it is necessary to becareful about spaces if the argument starts with a '('.  For example:              | ?- \+ (P, Q).is the '\+'/1 operator applied to the conjunction of P and Q, but             | ?- \+(P, Q).would require a predicate '\+'/2 for its solution.  The prefix operator can,however, be written as a functor of one argument; thus             | ?- \+((P,Q)).is also correct.See also library(not) in the Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual which definesa safer form of negation as failure.
