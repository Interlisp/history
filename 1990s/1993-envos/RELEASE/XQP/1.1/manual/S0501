sysdep-5-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                         Section 5-1: The Help SystemThe Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide, the Xerox Quintus Prolog ReferenceManual, the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual, and theXerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual are available on-line.  The help system ismenu-driven, with menus corresponding to the chapters within a manual, thesections within a chapter, and so on.  There is also topic-based access:help(Topic) is analogous to looking up Topic in an index.  Topics can beabbreviated, and menus are generated in ambiguous situations.  See{manual(sysdep-6)} for a complete description of the on-line help system.
