sysdep-6-1-0            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                         Section 6-1-0: IntroductionThe XQPInfo tool can be entered either from the background menu or by using oneof the Prolog predicates described in {manual(sysdep-6-2)}.  Invoking XQPInfowill bring up a browser on the Xerox Quintus Prolog documents.  Mostinteraction with XQPInfo is done through menus at the top of each graphbrowser.The Expanded Menu may be closed independently of the graph browser, andreopened by selecting Expanded Menu from the title bar menu.  Except for thiscommand, the commands in the title bar menu are identical to their counterpartsin the Expanded Menu.  If you were looking at the Reference Manual node, forexample, the Expanded Menu would look like:  Node:  Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference ManualTop!  Xerox Quintus Prolog On-line Documentation SystemParent!  Xerox Quintus Prolog On-line Documentation SystemPrevious!  Built-in OperatorsNext!  IntroductionDisplay: Graph Menu Text HistoryFind! Lookup! NextRef! GoToRef!The commands NextRef! and GoToRef! on the last menu line are specific to XeroxQuintus Prolog.  All of the above commands are activated by selecting thebolded words.
