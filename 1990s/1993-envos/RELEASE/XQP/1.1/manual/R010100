A term is either aconstant, a variable, or a compound term.A constant is either a number (integer or floating-point) or an atom.Constants are definite elementary objects, and correspond to proper nouns innatural language.Variables and compound terms are described in {manual(ref-1-1-4)}, and{manual(ref-1-2)}, respectively.
