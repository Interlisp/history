ref-5-5-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 5-5-2: line_count(+Stream, -N)line_count(Stream, N) unifies N with the total number of lines either read orwritten on the open stream Stream.  A freshly opened stream has a line count of1.  See {manual(ref-5-5-4)}, for details on the use of this predicate on astream which is directed to the user's terminal.If the Stream argument does not specify an open stream, then line_count(Stream,N) sends an error message to the standard error stream and aborts.  If N isinstantiated to a non-integer, line_count/2 fails with a "bad argument" errormessage and begins tracing.
