user-6-11-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide         Section 6-11-2: Exhaustively Tracing Execution of a ProgramA detailed trace is begun to follow the execution of the program.  Each timethe system displays a procedure call followed by a question mark, the Returnkey is pressed to direct the system to display the next step in the executionof the program.An error is found when the program checks to see if flight u100 could connectto flight u101.  In order for the flights to connect, flight u101 must departafter flight u100 arrives; that is, the departure time (in hours) of flightu101 must be greater than the arrival time of flight u100.  In the currentprogram, the clause checks to see if the departure time of flight u101 is lessthan, rather than greater than, the arrival time of flight u100.Once the error is found, 'a' is typed to abort execution of the program.Before correcting this error, we will look at another way of tracking it down.| ?- meet_on(When). <CR>   (1) 0 Call: meet_on(_83) ? <CR>   (2) 1 Call: could_meet([san_francisco,los_angeles,seattle],seattle,_83)? <CR>   (3) 2 Call: travel_ok(_83,san_francisco,seattle) ? s <CR> > (3) 2 Exit: travel_ok(monday,san_francisco,seattle) ? <CR>   (6) 2 Call: could_meet([los_angeles,seattle],seattle,monday) ? <CR>   (7) 3 Call: travel_ok(monday,los_angeles,seattle) ? s <CR> > (7) 3 Fail: travel_ok(monday,los_angeles,seattle) ? r <CR>[Debugger: retry goal]   (7) 3 Call: travel_ok(monday,los_angeles,seattle) ? <CR>   (17) 4 Call: one_step(monday,los_angeles,seattle,_384) ? s <CR> > (17) 4 Fail: one_step(monday,los_angeles,seattle,_384) ? <CR>   (19) 4 Call: two_step(monday,los_angeles,seattle,_384) ? <CR>   (20) 5 Call: flight(monday,_409,los_angeles,_421) ? <CR>   (20) 5 Exit: flight(monday,u100,los_angeles,san_francisco) ? <CR>   (21) 5 Call: flight(monday,_410,san_francisco,seattle) ? <CR>   (21) 5 Exit: flight(monday,u101,san_francisco,seattle) ? <CR>   (22) 5 Call: connects(u100,u101) ? s <CR> > (22) 5 Fail: connects(u100,u101) ? r <CR>[Debugger: retry goal]   (22) 5 Call: connects(u100,u101) ? <CR>   (26) 6 Call: flight_time(u100,_514,_515) ? <CR>   (26) 6 Exit: flight_time(u100,800,900) ? <CR>   (27) 6 Call: flight_time(u101,_524,_525) ? <CR>   (27) 6 Exit: flight_time(u101,1000,1200) ? <CR>   (28) 6 Call (built-in): 1000<900 ? a <CR>[ Execution aborted ]| ?- {select connects/2 and load it into Prolog      by selecting the Consult option of the TEdit menu}[consulting procedure connects/2][consultation completed (6.032 sec)]yes| ?- notrace. <CR>[the debugger is switched off]yes| ?- meet_on(When). <CR>no
