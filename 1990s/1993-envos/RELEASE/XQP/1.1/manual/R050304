ref-5-3-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                  Section 5-3-4: open(+File, +Mode, -Stream)open(File, Mode, Stream) attempts to open the file File in mode Mode.  If theopen/3 request is successful, a stream object, which can be subsequently usedfor input or output to the given file, is unified with Stream.NOTE:  If the name of File contains any special characters (such as period,'{', '$', and so on) , it must be enclosed in single quotes.File is a filename.  Mode is one of the atoms 'read', 'write', or 'append'.The 'read' option is used for input.  The 'write' and 'append' options are usedfor output.  The 'write' option causes a new file to be created for output.  Ifthe file already exists, then it is set to empty and its previous contents arelost.  The 'append' option opens an already-existing file and adds output tothe end of it.  The 'append' option will create the file if it does not alreadyexist.The 'read' option generates an error condition if the file does not exist.This will either send an error message to the standard error stream and callabort/0 (the default) or simply fail, depending on the state of the'fileerrors' flag (see {manual(ref-5-3-8)}).
