sysdep-6-0            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                          Section 6-0: IntroductionThe documentation for Xerox Quintus Prolog which is available both in printedand on-line form comprises the Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide, the XeroxQuintus Prolog Reference Manual, this Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependentFeatures Manual, and the Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual.  In addition tothe printed documents, this material is also available on-line using specialbuilt-in predicates which are described below.  These predicates view themanuals as a single tree structure.  This tree structure is traversed usingXQPInfo, which is a slightly modified version of the Xerox DInfo tool which wassupplied with the Koto version of Xerox Quintus Prolog.  The features ofXQPInfo are described below.There are two ways of finding information in the help system.  The first is towork through the XQPInfo graph of the hierarchy of chapters, sections, andsubsections.  This method of access is analogous to looking through the Tableof Contents sections of the printed documents.The second method is by keyword search.  This is analogous to looking up atopic or keyword in the Index section of a printed manual.  Both methods offinding information can be driven either by the XQPInfo tool, as describedbelow, or by Prolog predicates, as described in {manual(sysdep-6-2)}.  TheXQPInfo tool is part of the Xerox Quintus Prolog sysout.  There is nothingextra to load.
