ref-11-6-10                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                        Section 11-6-10: leash(+Mode)leash(Mode) sets the leashing mode to Mode.  The purpose of leash/1 is to allowyou to speed up single-stepping (creeping) through a program by telling thedebugger that it does not always need to wait for user input after printing atrace message.The leashing mode only applies to procedures that do not have spypoints onthem, and it determines which ports of such procedures are leashed.  Bydefault, all four ports are leashed.  On arrival at a leashed port, thedebugger will stop to allow you to look at the execution state and decide whatto do next.  At unleashed ports, the goal is displayed but program executiondoes not stop to allow user interaction.Mode should either be the atom 'all', for leashing on all four ports, or else alist containing zero or more of the atoms 'call', 'exit', 'redo', and 'fail'.Thus, for example,             | ?- leash([]).turns off all leashing; now when you creep you will get an exhaustive trace butno opportunity to interact with the debugger.  The command             | ?- leash([call,redo]).leashes on the Call and Redo ports.  When creeping, the debugger will now stopat every Call and Redo port to allow you to interact.If Mode is not of the proper form, leash/1 fails, an error message is sent tothe standard error stream, and the system enters the debugger in trace mode.In DEC-10 Prolog, a different form of argument was used for leash/1.  Thisform, in which the argument is an integer from 0 to 15, is also supported byXerox Quintus Prolog, but is not recommended, since the new form is clearer.
