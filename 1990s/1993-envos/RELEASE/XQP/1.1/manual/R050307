ref-5-3-7                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual             Section 5-3-7: current_stream(?File, ?Mode, ?Stream)current_stream(File, Mode, Stream) succeeds if Stream is a stream which iscurrently open on file File in mode Mode, where Mode is either 'read', 'write',or 'append'.  None of the arguments need be initially instantiated.  Thispredicate is non-determinate and can be used to backtrack through all openstreams.  It fails when there are no (further) matching open streams.If File, Mode, or Stream is in the wrong format, current_stream/3 simply fails.current_stream/3 has no associated error conditions.current_stream/3 ignores the three special streams for the standard input,output, and error channels.
