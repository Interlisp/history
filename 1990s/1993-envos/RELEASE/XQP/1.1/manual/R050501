ref-5-5-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                 Section 5-5-1: character_count(+Stream, -N)character_count(Stream, N) unifies N with the total number of characters eitherread or written on the open stream Stream.  A freshly opened stream has acharacter count of 0.  See {manual(ref-5-5-4)}, for details on the use ofcharacter_count/2 on a stream which is directed to the user's terminal.If the Stream argument does not specify an open stream, thencharacter_count(Stream, N) sends an error message to the standard error streamand aborts.  If N is instantiated to a non-integer, the predicate simply fails.If N is a variable, character_count/2 fails, and an error message is sent tothe standard error stream.  The system then enters the debugger in trace mode.
