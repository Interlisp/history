user-6-0                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                            Section 6-0: OverviewThis chapter explains the debugging facilities that are available in XeroxQuintus Prolog.  The debugging facilities provide you with informationconcerning the control flow of your program, so you can find problem areas.With the debugger, you can exhaustively trace each step of your program; or, ifyou want less detail, you can set spypoints (that is, breakpoints) on selectedprocedures and monitor the execution of those procedures only.  A wide range ofcontrol and information options are available during debugging, enabling you totailor the debugging process further to meet your needs.  In addition, theConsult and Compile commands are available from the debugger prompt, so thatprocedures may be reloaded during a debugging session.NOTE:  Any Lisp code called by Xerox Quintus Prolog can be debugged in thenormal fashion.
