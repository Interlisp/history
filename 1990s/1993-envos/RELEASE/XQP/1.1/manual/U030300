user-3-3-0                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                         Section 3-3-0: IntroductionXerox Quintus Prolog provides an on-line help system, which contains on-lineversions of this user's guide, the Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual, theXerox Quintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual, and the Xerox QuintusProlog Library Manual.  An overview is presented here; for more detailedinformation, see the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual.The on-line help system is displayed through the use of the XQPInfo tool, whichis part of the Xerox Quintus Prolog sysout.  There is nothing extra to load.As XQPInfo is very similiar to DInfo, only a brief overview of its features ispresented here, with emphasis on the small differences from the DInfo package.
