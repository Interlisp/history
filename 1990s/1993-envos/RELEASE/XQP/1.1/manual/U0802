user-8-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                     Section 8-2: Floating-point NumbersXerox Quintus Prolog, unlike DEC-10 Prolog, provides floating-point numbers.The main problem this poses for porting is that the symbol '/' is used in XeroxQuintus Prolog for floating-point division rather than for integer division.The symbol for integer division (which truncates fractional parts of theanswer) is '//'.  This is consistent with C-Prolog.  If you are moving aprogram from DEC-10 Prolog to Xerox Quintus Prolog, the compatibility checkerwill spot all occurrences of '/' in expressions to be evaluated (such as in theright-hand argument of is/2) so that they can be changed if necessary.Another possible porting problem is the additional use of '.' in floating-pointnumbers.  If '.' is declared to be an infix operator, then 1.2 represents alist cell in DEC-10 Prolog and a floating-point number in Xerox Quintus Prolog.
