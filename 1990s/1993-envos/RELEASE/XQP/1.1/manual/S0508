sysdep-5-8            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                        Section 5-8: Memory ManagementThe space occupied by interpreted code is reclaimed when clauses are retractedor procedures are abolished.  This reclamation is not delayed untilbacktracking as in DEC-10 Prolog.  The space occupied by compiled code is notreclaimed.  For further information on Xerox Quintus Prolog's memorymanagement, see {manual(sysdep-3)}.In Xerox Quintus Prolog, unlike other Quintus Prolog implementations, there isno stack shifter.The Xerox Quintus Prolog garbage collector is an improvement over the DEC-10Prolog garbage collector in that it is incremental; this means that it avoidsgarbage collecting the part of the heap (global stack) which has not changedsince a previous garbage collection.The predicate statistics/2 is fully backward-compatible with DEC-10 Prolog.The data areas in Xerox Quintus Prolog are slightly differently organized, butthe DEC-10 Prolog statistics keywords (for example,"statistics(global_stack, X)") still give meaningful results.  See{manual(sysdep-3-1-2)}, for further details.
