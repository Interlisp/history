ref-6-1-6                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 6-1-6: print(?X)print(X) writes X to the current output stream.  By default, the effect of thispredicate is the same as that of write/1, but you can change its effect byproviding clauses for the predicate portray/1.If X is a variable, then it is printed using write(X).  Otherwise theuser-definable procedure portray(X) is called.  If this succeeds, then it isassumed that X has been printed and print/1 exits (succeeds).  Note thatprint/1 always calls portray/1 in module 'user'.  Therefore, to be visible toprint/1, portray/1 must either be defined in or imported into module 'user'.If the call to portray/1 fails, and if X is a compound term, then write/1 isused to write the principal functor of X and print/1 is called recursively onits arguments.  If X is atomic, it is written using write/1.When print/1 has to print a list, say [X1,X2,...,Xn], it passes the whole listto portray/1.  As usual, if portray/1 succeeds, it is assumed to have printedthe entire list, and print/1 does nothing further with this term.  Otherwiseprint/1 writes the list using bracket notation, calling print/1 on each elementof the list in turn.Since [X1,X2,...,Xn] is simply a different way of writing .(X1,[X2,...,Xn]),one might expect print/1 to be called recursively on the two arguments X1 and[X2,...,Xn], giving portray/1 a second chance at [X2,...,Xn].  This does nothappen; lists are a special case in which print/1 is called separately for eachof X1,X2,...Xn.If you would like lists of character codes printed by print/1 usingdouble-quote notation, you should include library(printchars) (see the XeroxQuintus Prolog Library Manual) as part of your version of portray/1.print/1 is called from within the system in two places:     1. to print the bindings of variables after a question has succeeded   2. to print a goal during debugging print/1 always succeeds without error, except for any errors which may occur inthe execution of portray/1.
