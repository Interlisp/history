ref-6-5-6                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                Section 6-5-6: stream_position(?Stream, ?Pos)stream_position(Stream, Pos) is true when Stream is a stream objectrepresenting an open stream, Pos is a stream position object, and the currentposition of Stream is Pos.This operation makes sense on any stream at all:  streams which are connectedto disk files, streams which are connected to sockets, streams which areconnected to the terminal (including the standard streams 'user_input','user_output', and 'user_error'), and even streams defined usingQP_make_stream().To find the current position of a stream without changing it, one can ask             | ?- stream_position(Stream, Pos).stream_position/2 is a pure predicate; it acts as if it were a simple table ofunit clauses.  If it is given inappropriate arguments, it simply fails, just asa table of unit clauses would.  If the Stream argument is unbound, it willenumerate each of the currently open streams in an undefined order.stream_position/2 has no associated error conditions.
