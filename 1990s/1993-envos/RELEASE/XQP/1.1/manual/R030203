ref-3-2-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                   Section 3-2-3: use_module(+FileSpecList)use_module(FileSpecList) imports the public predicates of all themodule-file(s) on FileSpecList.Each file in FileSpecList must be a module-file.  If a file in FileSpecList isnot a module-file, an error message will be printed and that file will beignored.  If a specified module-file has not previously been loaded, it iscompiled unless the use_module/1 goal is embedded in a file which is beingconsulted, in which case it is consulted instead.If FileSpecList is not a valid file specification or a list of valid filespecifications, use_module/1 sends an error message to the standard errorstream, then succeeds with no other effect.After loading a module-file, the source module will attempt to import all thepublic predicates of the module-file.  It is possible that not all of thepublic predicates in the files on FileSpecList will actually be imported; aname clash may prevent the importation of a predicate.  If a directive of theform            :- use_module(FileSpecList).appears in a file being loaded, then the relative file specification isresolved with respect to the directory which contains the file being loaded.
