ref-11-7                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 11-7: maxdepth(+D)maxdepth(D) specifies that the maximum number of nested interpreted procedurecalls is D; beyond this the interpreter will cause a trap to the debugger.  Dshould be a positive integer.  The usual debugger options can be used when theinterpreter traps.  The Prolog top level has a depth of zero.  maxdepth/1 isuseful for guarding against loops in untested programs.  See the Xerox QuintusProlog System-dependent Features Manual for the default maxdepth for yoursystem.NOTE:  Calls to compiled procedures are not included in the depth, and calls tointerpreted code from compiled code will start again from a depth of zero.If D is an integer less than 1, maxdepth(D) sets the maximum system depth to 1.If D is not an integer, maxdepth(D) simply fails.
