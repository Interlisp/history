ref-8-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 8-2: ?T1 == ?T2T1 == T2 succeeds if the terms currently instantiating T1 and T2 are literallyidentical (in particular, variables in equivalent positions in the two termsmust be identical).  For example, the query             | ?- T1 == T2.fails because T1 and T2 are distinct uninstantiated variables.  However, thequery             | ?- T1 = T2, T1 == T2.succeeds because the first goal unifies the two variables.'=='/2 has no associated error conditions.
