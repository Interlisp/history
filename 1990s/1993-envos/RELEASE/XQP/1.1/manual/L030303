lib-3-3-3                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                 Section 3-3-3: number_chars(?Number, ?Chars)Chars is the list of character codes comprising the printed representation ofNumber.  Initially, either Number must be instantiated to a number, or Charsmust be instantiated to a proper list of character codes.If Number is initially instantiated to a number, Chars is unified with the listof character codes that make up its printed representation.  If Number isuninstantiated and Chars is initially instantiated to a list of characters thatcorresponds to the correct syntax of a number (either integer or float), Numberis bound to that number; otherwise number_chars/2 will simply fail.  If thearguments to number_chars/2 are both uninstantiated, it fails, and an errormessage is sent to the standard error stream.  The system then enters thedebugger in trace mode.number_chars/2 was built into the system in Release 2.0.  Before that, it was alibrary predicate.  library(strings) still contains the old code under the namenumber_chars1/2.
