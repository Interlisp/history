ref-6-6-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 6-6-5: telling(-S)telling(S) unifies S with the current output stream.  This is exactly the sameas current_output(S() {manual(ref-6-3-14)}), except that S will be unified witha file name if the current output stream was opened by tell/1.If S is not a file name or stream object corresponding to an open outputstream, telling(S) simply fails.A common usage of telling/1 is            tell('Some File Name')            ...            telling('Some File Name')telling/1 should succeed if the current input stream was not changed (or ifchanged, restored).  It succeeds for any file name (including 'user') and anystream object opened by open/3 ({manual(ref-6-3-4)}), but fails for'user_output' and any stream object opened by tell/1 ({manual(ref-6-6-4)}).Passing file names to tell/1 is the only DEC-10 Prolog usage of telling/1, soXerox Quintus Prolog is compatible with this usage.WARNING:  The sequence            telling(File),            ...            set_output(File),will fail if the current output stream was opened by tell/1.  The onlysequences that are guaranteed to succeed are            telling(FileOrStream),            ...            tell(FileOrStream)and            current_output(Stream),            ...            set_output(Stream)
