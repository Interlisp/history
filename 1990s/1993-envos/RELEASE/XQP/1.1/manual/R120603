ref-12-6-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 12-6-3: nodebugnodebug/0 turns the debugger off (nodebug/0 and notrace/0 are equivalent).Turning the debugger off does not remove any spypoints.  Spypoints will remainwhere they were set, although they will have no effect while the debugger isoff.  When the debugger is turned on again, the spypoints will again takeeffect.  If you want to remove all your spypoints, use nospyall/0({manual(ref-12-6-8)}).nodebug/0 has no associated error conditions.
