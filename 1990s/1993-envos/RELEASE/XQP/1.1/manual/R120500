'prompt, which is displayed after the debugger prints out a goal.  The optionsare one-letter mnemonics, some of which optionally can be followed by a decimalinteger.  Any layout characters are completely ignored up to the next newline.The most important option to remember is 'h' (followed by <CR>).  When you type'h' (for help), the following list of available options is displayed:Debugging options: <CR>  creep      p      print         r      retry        @    command c     creep      w      write         r <i>  retry i      b    break l     leap       d      display       f      fail         a    abort s     skip       g      ancestors     f <i>  fail i       h    help n     nodebug    g <n>  n ancestors   +      spy this     ?    help x     backup     < <n>  set depth     -      nospy this   =    debugging                  .      find defnThese options provide a number of different functions which fall into thefollowing classes:Basic control     - The basic ways of continuing with the executionPrinting          - Showing the goal, or its ancestors, in various waysAdvanced control  - Affecting control flowEnvironment       - Changing spypoints, executing commands, breaking and                    aborting, access to source codeHelp              - Showing the debugger state and listing optionsEach of the options is described below.
