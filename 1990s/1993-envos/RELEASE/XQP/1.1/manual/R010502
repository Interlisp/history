ref-1-5-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual              Section 1-5-2: current_op(?Precedence, ?Type, ?Op)current_op(Precedence, Type, Op) succeeds when the atom Op is currently anoperator of type Type and precedence Precedence.  None of the arguments need beinstantiated at the time of the call; that is, this predicate can be used tofind the precedence or type of an operator, to backtrack through operators, andso on.Type, if instantiated, must be one of the atoms             xfx  xfy  yfx  fx  fy  xf  yfand Precedence, if instantiated, must be an integer in the range 1 to 1200.If an instantiated argument is not of the expected form, current_op/3 gives anerror message and fails.To add or remove an operator, use op/3 ({manual(ref-1-5-1)}).
