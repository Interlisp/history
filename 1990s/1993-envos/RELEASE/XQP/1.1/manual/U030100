Both the Prolog program and yourinteraction with Prolog are preserved in edit buffers which can easily bereviewed.  The Prolog source program appears in one or more TEdit windows, andthe Prolog environment appears in a special Prolog window on another part ofthe screen.In the Prolog window, Prolog programs can be run; in the TEdit windows, singleprocedures, groups of procedures, and entire programs can be edited and quicklyreloaded into Prolog without suspending the Prolog process.  Additionally, anynumber of Prolog source files can be loaded into Prolog at once; then, ifdesired, a special TEdit function can be used to locate a specific procedure inany one of those files.
