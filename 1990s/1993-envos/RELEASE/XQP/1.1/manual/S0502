sysdep-5-2            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                     Section 5-2: Floating-point NumbersXerox Quintus Prolog provides floating-point numbers (floats).  Examples ofacceptable syntax for floats are0.0   -1.0   0.54   1000.0   1.0E6   12.345678e-12A float has approximately 6 decimal digits of precision.  Its magnitude, ifnonzero, must be in the approximate range of 1.3E-45 to 3E38.In Xerox Quintus Prolog, the symbol '/' is used for floating-point divisionrather than integer division; that is, its result is always a float.  Thesymbol for integer division (which truncates any fractional part of an answer)is '//'.  This is consistent with C-Prolog.There are two new arithmetic functors for coercing integers to floats and viceversa.  For example,             | ?- X is 2.5, Y is integer(X), Z is float(Y).            X = 2.5,            Y = 2,            Z = 2.0Note that the effect of the arithmetic functor integer/1 in an expression is totruncate its argument -- the fractional part is thrown away.  It should not beconfused with the predicate integer/1 which, as in DEC-10 Prolog, succeeds ifand only if its argument is instantiated to an integer.  There are two newsimilar predicates:float(?N) - true if N is instantiated to a floating-point numbernumber(?N)  -            true if N is instantiated to an integer or a float
