user-7-4                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                         Section 7-4: Style CheckingBy default, Xerox Quintus Prolog gives certain warning messages as it compilesor consults a program (see {manual(user-3-7)}).  When developing new programs,this has been found to be extremely useful in catching editing mistakes, butthe warnings can be a nuisance when porting programs which have not beenwritten with the supported style conventions in mind.  If this is the case, youmay want to turn them all off with            | ?- no_style_check(all).However, it is recommended that you at least retain checking for multipledefinitions of the same procedure, since this catches the case in which thedefinition of a procedure is spread over more than one file (which will notwork under Xerox Quintus Prolog, unless the procedure has been declaredmultifile).  To get this multiple definition checking, call            | ?- style_check(multiple).It is generally advisable to modify your programs to eliminate allstyle_check/1 warnings:  longstanding bugs in existing programs have been foundby using the style warnings.  Note that you can change your programs to conformto Xerox Quintus Prolog style conventions without affecting your programs'ability to run under DEC-10 Prolog or C-Prolog.
