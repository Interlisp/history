ref-18-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                 Section 18-4: prolog_flag(?FlagName, ?Value)prolog_flag(FlagName, Value) is true when FlagName is one of the currentlysupported "global variables" and Value is its current value.  Currently, thesupported FlagNames and Values are     character_escapes 'on' or 'off'     debugging         'trace', 'debug', or 'off'     fileerrors        'on' or 'off'     gc                'on' or 'off'     gc_margin         non-negative integer                       in thousands of bytes                          (not available on some systems)     gc_trace          'verbose', 'terse', or 'off'     module            a module name     unknown           'trace' or 'fail'To inspect the value of a flag without changing it, one can say             | ?- prolog_flag(FlagName, Value).This is a true predicate.  You can use it to enumerate all the FlagNames whichthe system currently understands.  It is possible to:   1. Determine whether the escaping of special characters in I/O      operations is enabled or disabled.   2. Determine whether trace or debug mode is enabled.   3. Determine whether file errors will be reported or not.   4. Determine how the garbage collector will behave.   5. Look at the number of bytes that must be reclaimed by a garbage      collection in order to avoid heap expansion.   6. Determine whether diagnostic tracing of garbage collections will      happen.   7. Determine what the type-in module is.  The module/1 command (see      {manual(ref-12-8)}) can be used to change it, but the only way of      finding out which module is currently selected is to call      prolog_flag/[2,3].   8. Determine whether calling an unknown procedure will trap to the      debugger or will simply fail (see {manual(ref-11-6-9)}).  unknown(X,      X) has the same effect, but also sends a message to user_output.See the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual for more detaileddescriptions of the garbage collection flags.
