ref-12-3-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual            Section 12-3-5: Choosing an Option at a Debugging PortEach time the debugger reaches a leashed port, it stops and prompts you tospecify the next action it should take.  What you type determines which goalwill be displayed next by the debugger.  There are four fundamental options(selected using the characters shown):  c           creep            Causes the debugger to single-step to the very next port and print            the goal.  If the port is leashed, the debugger prompts you for            further interaction.  Otherwise, the debugger continues creeping,            printing goals until it reaches a leashed port or a port of a            procedure on which there is a spypoint.l           leap            Causes the debugger to resume running your program, only stopping            when the next spypoint is reached, or when the program finishes.s           skip            Causes the debugger to skip, or ignore, the internal details of a            procedure's execution.  The debugger starts showing goals again            when execution returns to the procedure's Exit or Fail port.r           retry            Transfers control back to the Call port of the box.  This allows            you to restart an invocation when, for example, you find yourself            leaving with some incorrect result.  The state of execution is            exactly the same as when you originally called the procedure except            that clauses that have been modified by data base modification            predicates such as assert/1 will not be changed back to their            original states.
