ref-7-3-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                         Section 7-3-0: IntroductionEach of the following predicates evaluates each of its arguments as anarithmetic expression, then compares the results.  If one argument evaluates toan integer and the other to a float, the integer is coerced to a float beforethe comparison is made.Note that two floating-point numbers are equal if and only if they have thesame bit pattern.  Because of rounding error, it is not normally useful tocompare two floats for equality.
