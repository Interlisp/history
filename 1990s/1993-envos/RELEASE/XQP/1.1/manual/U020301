user-2-3-1                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                    Section 2-3-1: Basic Operation of HelpThe XQPInfo tool can be entered either from the background menu or as describedin {manual(user-2-3-3)}.  Once the system is started, the main window will havean extended menu at the top.  If you were looking at the Reference Manual node,for example, this extended menu would look like:Node:  Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference ManualTop!  Xerox Quintus Prolog On-line Documentation SystemParent!  Xerox Quintus Prolog On-line Documentation SystemPrevious!  Built-in OperatorsNext!  IntroductionDisplay: Graph Menu Text HistoryFind! Lookup! NextRef! GoToRef!With the exception of NextRef! and GoToRef! on the last menu line, all of thesecommands work exactly the same as the corresponding DInfo commands, and areactivated by selecting the bolded words.It is most useful to begin by activating the Text and the Graph functions.  TheText function (the default) when activated opens the text window below theextended menu window.  Note that not all positions in the graph have textassociated with them, and in this case the message "This node has no text" willbe displayed.The Graph function shows the hierarchical organization of the manuals as agraph of a tree structure, with the current location highlighted.  As youtraverse the tree structure by selecting the words themselves in the graph, thecurrent location is updated.The Lookup! function, when activated, prompts for a character string to lookup, then composes a menu of all the index entries beginning with that string.To choose one of these menu entries, simply left-mouse it; the XQPInfo systemwill find the location of that entry in the manual hierarchy and display it.This is very similar to using an index in a paper manual.
