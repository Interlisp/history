lib-7-5-1                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                       Section 7-5-1: library(read_in)read_in(-Sentence)            reads characters from the current input stream until it finds            end-of-file or a sentence terminator (see is_period/1) at the end            of a line.  There may be any number of tabs and spaces between that            stop and the end of the line.  It then breaks the characters up            into "words", where a "word" is               - a sequence of letters (see is_alpha/1) which is converted                 to lowercase and returned as a Prolog atom               - a sequence of decimal digits (see is_digit/1) which is                 returned as a Prolog integer (plus and minus signs become                 separate atoms).               - any graphic character other than a letter or digit, which                 is returned as a single-character Prolog atom            The resulting list is returned in Sentence.  The punctuation mark            which terminated the sentence is included in the list.  Here is an            example:            | ?- read_in(X).            |: This is an example.  An example of read-in.  In            |: it there are +00003 sentences!            X = [this,is,an,example,.,an,example,of,read,-,                 in,.,in,it,there,are,+,3,sentences,!]            Note that the end-of-line character, and any spaces and tabs            following the sentence terminator, are consumed.  It is important            that the end-of-line character be consumed; otherwise subsequent            prompts will behave unpredictably.
