user-3-2-0                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                       Section 3-2-0: Basic InformationTo load a program from TEdit into Prolog, move the cursor into the TEdit windowcontaining your program, and then select the region of the program you want toload.The region you select can encompass as much or as little of the program as youlike.  Being able to load a designated portion of your program is veryconvenient if you are running a program and discover that you need to make afew changes to make the program work better.  You can make your changes andthen reload just the changed portions, as described below, without reloadingthe entire program.  If you are just beginning a Prolog session, however, youwill probably want to load your entire program.To select a region to load, move the cursor to the top of the region and pressthe left mouse button; then move the cursor to the bottom of the region andpress the right mouse button.  If you select a region containing more than oneprocedure, make sure that the region includes all the clauses for all theprocedures in that region.To select just one procedure, position the cursor in the left margin of theTEdit window next to the procedure (not in the scroll bar region that appearsif you move the cursor past the left edge of the window).  Note that thedirection of the mouse cursor arrow changes as it enters the left margin area.Press the middle mouse button.After you select a region or procedure, you load it into Prolog by selectingthe Consult or Compile option of the TEdit menu.  To load a region through theinterpreter, select the Consult option; to load it through the compiler, selectthe Compile option.To load the entire contents of the window, select the Consult or Compileoptions with no regions marked in the window.NOTE:  The TEdit Consult and Compile facilities require that you follow certainsyntactic and structural conventions when you write your Prolog code.  For moreinformation, see {manual(user-5-1)}.After you indicate how much of your program to load, Prolog displays a messagetelling you that it is loading the program.  As it proceeds, Prolog displaysmessages to let you know which procedures are being loaded.  For example, ifyour program consisted of procedures for parts_of/2, assembly/2, andinventory/2, Prolog would display the messages:            | ?-            [ consulting procedure parts_of/2 ]            [ consulting procedure assembly/2 ]            [ consulting procedure inventory/2 ]            [ consultation completed (1.400 sec)]            yes            | ?-At this point, you can begin to run your program (see {manual(user-4)}).NOTE:  When you load procedures into Prolog, Prolog first removes any previousversions (either consulted or compiled) of those procedures from its data base,excepting those procedures that have been declared multifile.  A multifiledeclaration indicates that a particular procedure is defined by clauses in morethan one file.  (For more information on multifile procedures, see the XeroxQuintus Prolog Reference Manual.)  This is why the entirety of a procedure mustbe loaded at once; otherwise, loading the definition of the second part wouldwipe out the definition of the first part.
