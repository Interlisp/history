lib-4-4-1                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                        Section 4-4-1: Term1 \= Term2library(not) defines another inequality predicate, as do the C-Prolog andDEC-10 Prolog libraries:Term1 \= Term2            Term1 and Term2 do not unifyThis means exactly the same thing as            \+ Term1 = Term2and is subject to the same problems as the use of unprovability to simulatenegation.  However, when the terms are ground, it is more efficient than'\=='/2.
