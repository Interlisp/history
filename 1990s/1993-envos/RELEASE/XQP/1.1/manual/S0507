sysdep-5-7            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual            Section 5-7: Improved Handling of Data Base ReferencesWhen a clause is retracted (or erased), or when a recorded term is erased, theclause (or term) disappears from the data base.  Safety is maintained in thatany attempt to access it via a data base reference (a "dangling pointer") willsimply fail.  Thus instance/2 and clause/3 cannot be used to get at clauses orrecorded terms which have been erased.  Note that this is different fromC-Prolog, where an "erased" clause or recorded term may be accessed usinginstance/2 as long as you hold onto a reference to it.  (For more informationas to the precise semantics of modifications to the Prolog data base, see thechapter on modifying the data base in the Xerox Quintus Prolog ReferenceManual).In Xerox Quintus Prolog, each data base reference defines a unique key.  Also,there is no restriction against asserting clauses containing data basereferences.
