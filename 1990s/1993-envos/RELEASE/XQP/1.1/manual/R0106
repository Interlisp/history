ref-1-6                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 1-6: Syntax RestrictionsNote carefully the following syntax restrictions, which serve to removepotential ambiguities associated with prefix operators.   1. The arguments of a compound term written in standard syntax must be      expressions of precedence less than 1000.  Thus it is necessary to      write the expression "P:-Q" in parentheses                   assert((P:-Q))      because the precedence of the infix operator ':-', and hence of the      expression "P:-Q", is 1200.  Enclosing the expression in parentheses      reduces its precedence to 0.   2. In a term written in standard syntax, the principal functor and its      following '(' must not be separated by any intervening spaces,      newlines, or other characters.  Thus                   point (X,Y,Z)      is invalid syntax.   3. If the argument of a prefix operator starts with a '(', this '('      must be separated from the operator by at least one space or other      layout character.  Thus                   :-(p;q),r.      (where ':-' is the prefix operator) is invalid syntax.  The system      would try to interpret it as the structure:                                ,                             / \                           :-    r                            |                            ;                           / \                          p   q      That is, it would take ':-' to be a functor of arity 1.  However,      since the arguments of a functor are required to be expressions of      precedence less than 1000, this interpretation would fail as soon as      the ';' (precedence 1100) were encountered.      In contrast, the term:                    :- (p;q),r.      is valid syntax and represents the following structure:                                :-                               |                               ,                              / \                             ;   r                            / \                           p   q   4. If a prefix operator is written without an argument (as an ordinary      atom), the atom is treated as an expression of the same precedence      as the prefix operator, and must therefore be written in parentheses      where necessary.  Thus the parentheses are necessary in                   X = (?-)      since the precedence of '?-' is 1200.
