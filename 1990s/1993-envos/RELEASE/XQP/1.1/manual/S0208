sysdep-2-8            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual       Section 2-8: load_foreign_files(+ListOfFiles, +ListOfLibraries)The load_foreign_files/2 predicate loads Lisp files, making the functions theydefine accessible to Prolog through the foreign function interface.ListOfFiles and ListOfLibraries are both (possibly empty) lists of file names.All of these files are loaded with the Lisp function FILESLOAD, so it is notnecessary to fully specify the file's extension.  load_foreign_files/2 willautomatically try to load a ".dfasl" or a ".LCOM" file, if it can find one.See the Interlisp-D Reference Manual for more information about FILESLOAD andloading Lisp files.load_foreign_files/2 first loads the files on ListOfLibraries from thedirectories on the list LISPUSERSDIRECTORIES (see the Interlisp-D ReferenceManual for more information about LISPUSERSDIRECTORIES).  Then the each of thefiles on ListOfFiles is loaded as follows:   1. If the file name is an absolute file name, the named file is loaded.   2. Otherwise, if the file name is a term library(File), File is loaded      from one of the directories specified by the user-controlled      predicate library_directory/1.   3. Otherwise, if the call to load_foreign_files/2 is made while a file      is being loaded, the file to be loaded is loaded from the directory      the file being loaded lives in, if it exists in that directory.   4. Otherwise, if the call to load_foreign_files/2 is made outside of      the context of loading a file, the file is loaded from the currently      connected directory, if it exists in that directory.  See the      Interlisp-D Reference Manual for a discussion of connecting to a      directory.   5. Otherwise, the file is loaded from one of the directories on the      Lisp global variable DIRECTORIES.  See the Interlisp-D Reference      Manual for a discussion of this variable.For example, if a Prolog module called the Lisp GRAPHER module, the file mightcontain the following goal::- load_foreign_files(['PROLOGGRAPHER', 'MYGRAPHERSTUFF'], ['GRAPHER']).
