sysdep-6-1-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                           Section 6-1-1: Main MenuNext to Node, Top, Parent, Previous, and Next are printed the name of the nodecurrently being visited, the name of the top node in the graph, the name of thenode previous to the current node, and the name of the node next to theprevious node, respectively.  Top, Parent, Previous, and Next are also commandsas follows:Top                                                      [XQPInfo Menu Command]            Visits the top node in the graph.Parent                                                   [XQPInfo Menu Command]            Visits the parent of the current node.Previous                                                 [XQPInfo Menu Command]            Visits the node previous to the current node.Next                                                     [XQPInfo Menu Command]            Visits the node following the current node.  Previous and Next thus            provide sequential access to the graph.Find                                                     [XQPInfo Menu Command]            Performs a text-find on the text of the current XQPInfo node.Lookup                                                   [XQPInfo Menu Command]            The Lookup! function merits special mention.  When activated, it            prompts for a character string to look up, then calls the LOOKUPFN            of the graph to compose a menu of all the index entries beginning            with that string.  To choose one of these menu entries, simply            press the left mouse button while it is on the entry; the XQPInfo            system will find the location of that entry in the manual hierarchy            and display it.  This is very similar to using an index in a paper            manual.  Pressing the middle mouse button will call the LOOKUPFN            again, with whatever string was last used.NextRef                                                  [XQPInfo Menu Command]            The NextRef! function is used to find cross-references embedded in            the text of the manual.  Cross-references in the text look like            manual/1 Prolog commands enclosed in curly braces (for example,            "{manual(ref-3-1-1)}").  Activating NextRef! will search the            currently displayed text for the next cross-reference.  If one            exists, the text display will be updated to show it in context.GoToRef                                                  [XQPInfo Menu Command]            The GoToRef! function is used to follow cross-references embedded            in the text of the manual which have been found by the NextRef!            function.  When the GoToRef! function is activated, the XQPInfo            system will locate the appropriate section of the manual and            display it.  You can always return to where you were by using the            History function, which provides a historical record of the visited            locations in the manual in the form of a menu of topic titles; any            title can be revisited by left-mousing it.
