ref-5-6                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 5-6: +P -> +Q ; +RThis is called a conditional goal and is read            "if P then Q else R"First P is executed.  If it succeeds, then Q is executed, and if Q fails, thewhole conditional goal fails.  If P fails, however, R is executed instead of Q.The character '|' can be used as an alternative to ';', giving the form            P -> Q | RThe '|' is transformed into a ';' when the goal is read.Note that if P succeeds and Q then fails, backtracking into P does not occur.P may not contain a cut.  '->'/2 acts like a cut except that its range isrestricted to within the disjunction:  it cuts away R and any choice pointswithin P.  '->' may be thought of as a "local cut".Note that the operator precedences of the ';' and '->'/2 are both greater than1000, so that they dominate commas.  For example,            p, q -> r, s ; tis equivalent to            ( (p,q) -> (r,s) ) ; t
