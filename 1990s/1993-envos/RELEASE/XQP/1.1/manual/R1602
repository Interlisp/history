ref-16-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                 Section 16-2: bagof(?Template, +Goal, -Bag)bagof/3 is is exactly the same as setof/3 except that the list (or alternativelists) returned will not be ordered, and may contain duplicates.  Thisrelaxation saves considerable time and space in execution.If Goal is an uninstantiated variable, bagof/3 fails, an error message is sentto the standard error stream, and the system enters the debugger in trace mode.
