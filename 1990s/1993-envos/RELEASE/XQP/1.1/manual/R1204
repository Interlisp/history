ref-12-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual         Section 12-4: Converting Non-module-files into Module-filesThe Prolog cross-referencer provided with Xerox Quintus Prolog canautomatically generate module/2 declarations from its cross-referenceinformation.  This is useful if you want to take a set of files making up aprogram and make each of those files into a module-file.  See the file'xref.doc' in the Prolog library directory for more information.Alternatively, if you have a complete Prolog program consisting of a set ofsource files {file1, file2, ...}, and you wish to encapsulate it in a singlemodule mod, then this can be done by creating a "driver" file of the followingform:              :- module(mod, [ ... ]).            :- ensure_loaded(file1).            :- ensure_loaded(file2).               .               .               .When a module is created in this way, none of the files in the program{file1, file2, ...} have to be changed.
