If you type 'trace.', Prolog will start by showing the step-by-stepexecution of all traceable procedures.  If you type 'debug.', you set up thedebugger to start showing selected portions of the execution of the proceduresyou specify.  The option you select sets the top-level debugging mode, but youcan select more or less detailed debugging any time the debugger stops andprompts you for interaction.Once the debugger is on, the debugging mode (trace or debug) is continuallydisplayed on the Prolog mode line at the bottom of the screen:  Xerox Quintus Prolog                             trace| ?-As shown in the example below, you can turn the debugger on by typing 'trace.'or 'debug.' at the main Prolog prompt.  | ?- trace.[The debugger will first creep -- showing everything (trace)]yes| ?-or:| ?- debug.[The debugger will first leap -- showing spypoints (debug)]yes| ?-
