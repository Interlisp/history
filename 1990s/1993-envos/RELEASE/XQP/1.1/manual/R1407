ref-14-7                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                     Section 14-7: instance(+Ref, -Term)instance(Ref, Term) unifies Term with a (most general) instance of the clauseor recorded term indicated by the data base reference Ref.  If the reference isto a unit clause C, then Term is unified with 'C :- true'.If Ref is not a data base reference to an existing clause or recorded term,instance/2 simply fails.
