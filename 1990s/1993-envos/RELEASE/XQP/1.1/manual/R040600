ref-4-6-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                         Section 4-6-0: IntroductionWherever a built-in predicate takes a non-absolute FileName as an argument, itcan also take library(FileName) as an argument.  When the system encounters afile specification of this form, it searches for the first occurrence of thefile in the directories specified by the user-defined predicatelibrary_directory/1, in the order in which its clauses appear in the data base.If both FileName.pl and FileName appear in the same directory, FileName.pl willbe used.  For more information, see the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependentFeatures Manual.
