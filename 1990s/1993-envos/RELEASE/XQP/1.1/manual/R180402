ref-18-4-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                Section 18-4-2: phrase(+Phrase, ?List, ?Rest)phrase(Phrase, List, Rest) succeeds when the portion of List between the startof List and the start of Rest is a phrase of type Phrase (according to thecurrent grammar rules), where Phrase is either a non-terminal or, moregenerally, a grammar rule body.In other words, if the search for a Phrase is started at the beginning of List,Rest is what remains after Phrase has been found.  For example,            | ?- phrase([Literal], List, Rest).            Literal = _824,            List = _843,            Rest = [Literal|List]phrase/3 allows variables to occur as non-terminals in grammar rule bodies,just as call/1 allows variables to occur as goals in clause bodies.  Forexample, the grammar rule            optional(Thing) --> Thing | [].will be translated to            optional(Thing, S0, S) :-                    phrase(Thing, S0, S)                    | S0 = S.which would also have resulted from the grammar rule            optional(Thing) --> phrase(Thing) | [].If Phrase is an unbound variable, phrase/3 fails, and an error message is sentto the standard error stream.  See phrase/2 ({manual(ref-18-4-3)}) for moreinformation about the Phrase argument.
