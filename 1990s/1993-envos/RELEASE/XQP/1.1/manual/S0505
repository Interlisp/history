sysdep-5-5            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                         Section 5-5: Style CheckingBy default, Xerox Quintus Prolog prints warnings, as it consults or compiles,about   1. single occurrences of a named variable in a clause, where "named" in      this context means that the variable name does not begin with an      underscore (_);   2. procedures for which all the clauses are not adjacent (contiguous)      in the source file; and   3. procedures for which clauses are encountered in more than one file      (multiple definitions).  (This warning is not activated if the      procedure has been declared multifile] See the chapter on loading      programs in the Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual for more      information.)  In DEC-10 Prolog it is possible to spread the      definition of a procedure across more than one file if you use      consult/1, but not if you use compile/1 or reconsult/1.  This style      warning can be useful in catching any attempt to do this.These warnings can be very helpful in catching typing mistakes, and it ishighly recommended that you adapt your programming style to make the best useof them.  Style checking can be fully controlled by the predicatesstyle_check/1 and no_style_check/1 which each take as argument any of the fouratoms below:   all              turn on/off all style checking   single_var       turn on/off checking for single variable occurrences   discontiguous    turn on/off checking for discontiguous procedures   multiple         turn on/off checking for multiple definitions
