user-8-8                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                Section 8-8: Running the Compatibility CheckerThe checker is most conveniently run under TEdit, so that you can peruse itsoutput at your leisure rather than trying to read it as it is written.  Proceedas follows:            | ?- compile(library(checker)).             [compiling library(checker)...]            yes            | ?- check(file1).            {warnings output here}            [ file1 checked ]            yes            | ?- check(file2).            .            .            .The argument to check may be a list of files.  If a file has a '.pl' suffix,the suffix can be omitted.It may be useful to direct output from the checker to a file.  This can easilybe done by            | ?- tell(output-file), check(file), told.
