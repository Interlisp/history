For example, foreach(between(1,3,I), p(I)) is    equivalent to p(1), p(2), p(3).    Note that this is not the same as forall/2.  For example,    forall(between(1,3,I), p(I)) is equivalent to    \+ \+ p(1), \+ \+ p(2), \+ \+ p(3).    The trick in foreach is to ensure that the variables of Goal which    do not occur in Generator are restored properly.  (If there are no    such variables, you might as well use forall/2.)    Like forall/2, this predicate does a failure-driven loop over the    Generator.  Unlike forall/2, the Goals are executed as an ordinary    conjunction, and may succeed in more than one way.*/foreach(Generator, Goal) :-	free_variables(Goal, Generator, [], FreeVariables),		save_instances(FreeVariables-Goal, Generator),	conj_instances(true, FreeVariables).conj_instances(Goals, FreeVars) :-	recorded(., Term, Ref),	erase(Ref), !, 		%   must not backtrack	conj_instances(Term, Goals, FreeVars).conj_instances(-, Goals, _) :- !,	call(user:Goals).conj_instances(FreeVariables-Goal, Goals, FreeVariables) :-	conj_instances((Goal,Goals), FreeVariables).
