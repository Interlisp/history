Most of the files on this directory come from Quintus.  However, the PrologBoot process expects additional files to be on this directory, hence some files are maintained on this directory which are *not* from quintus, while other files are here merely because of PrologBoot.Thus, DO NOT SIMPLY DELETE THIS DIRECTORY WHEN A NEW RELEASE COMES FROM QUINTUS!!!!!!DInfo - not maintained here, but .dfasl must reside here because of PrologBoot.XQPM  - not maintained here, but .dfasl must reside here because of PrologBoot.Other directory comments (as of 9/25).NEWMAKEFILE has no DFASL (why not?)QPs is an unnecessary file
