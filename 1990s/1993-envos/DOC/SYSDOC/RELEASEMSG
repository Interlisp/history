Subject: SYSDOCRELEASETo: SYSDOCUSERS^, ISL^, AISBU^cc: guibert.paYES FOLKS, THE NEW IMPROVED VERSION OF THE SYSDOC MANUAL IS FINALLY RELEASED.It resides on {Phylum}<SYSDOCRELEASES>* There are ".press" versions of all the files and ".ip" versions of most all files to speed printing time.  The easiest means of getting your copy is to open a Filebrowser on the pattern:{Phylum}<SYSDOCRELEASES>*.press* if you use press printers  or{Phylum}<SYSDOCRELEASES>*.ip*if you use NS printers.Select a few files to hardcopy at a time or wait until off hours to make your copy.CAVEAT:  Due to the complexity of the sketches in Lesson 1, {PHYLUM}<SysDocReleases>INTRO-ISL-COMP-ENVIRON,this file takes a long time to load in and even longer (~15 minutes) to print.  When it does print the second page cannot handle the amount of information it is passed so the copy is really poor.  Consequently, I did not make a ".press" or ".ip" version of this file.  If you want this lesson you should get a hardcopy from the ISL Receptionist.Of note with this release is a GenericInit file* which should be particularly useful for new employees, but others of you may want to use it as well.  It automatically loads many packages which the general consensus seemed to desire.  The lesson, {PHYLUM}<SysDocReleases>InitFiles describes the concepts of Init files, describes the things this personal init file provides you with and walks you through a procedure to modify this Generic Init File to make it your own.Other new lessons in this release include:
