Pattern Matching1Interlisp provides a fairly general pattern match facility that allows you to specify certain tests that would otherwise be clumsy to write, by giving a pattern which the datum is supposed to match.   Essentially, you write ªDoes the (expression) X look like (the pattern) P?º  For example, (match X with (& 'A -- 'B)) asks whether the second element of X is an A, and the last element a B.  The implementation of the matching is performed by computing (once) the equivalent Interlisp expression which will perform the indicated operation, and substituting this for the pattern, and not by invoking each time a general purpose capability such as that found in FLIP or PLANNER.  For example, the translation of (match X with (& 'A -- 'B)) is:(AND (EQ (CADR X) 'A)    (EQ (CAR (LAST (CDDR X))) 'B))Thus the pattern match facility is really a pattern match compiler, and the emphasis in its design and implementation has been more on the efficiency of object code than on generality and sophistication of its matching capabilities.  The goal was to provide a facility that could and would be used even where efficiency was paramount, e.g., in inner loops.  As a result, the pattern match facility does not contain (yet) some of the more esoteric features of other pattern match languages, such as repeated patterns, disjunctive and conjunctive patterns, recursion, etc.  However, you can be confident that what facilities it does provide will result in Interlisp expressions comparable to those you would generate by hand.  Wherever possible, already existing Interlisp functions are used in the translation, e.g., the translation of ($ 'A $) uses MEMB, ($ ('A $) $) uses ASSOC, etc.The syntax for pattern match expressions is (match FORM with PATTERN), where PATTERN is a list as described below.  If FORM appears more than once in the translation, and it is not either a variable, or an expression that is easy to (re)compute, such as (CAR Y), (CDDR Z), etc.,  a dummy variable will be generated and bound to the value of FORM so that FORM is not evaluated a multiple number of times.  For example, the translation of (match (FOO X) with ($ 'A $)) is simply (MEMB 'A (FOO X)), while the translation of (match (FOO X) with ('A 'B --)) is as follows:[PROG ($$2)   (RETURN      (AND (EQ (CAR (SETQ $$2 (FOO X))) 'A)           (EQ (CADR $$2) 'B]In the interests of efficiency, the pattern match compiler assumes that all lists end in NIL, i.e., there are no LISTP checks inserted in the translation to check tails.  For example, the translation of (match X with ('A & --)) is (AND (EQ (CAR X) (QUOTE A)) (CDR X)), which will match with (A B) as well as (A . B).  Similarly, the pattern match compiler does not insert LISTP checks on elements, e.g., (match X with (('A --) --)) translates simply as (EQ (CAAR X) 'A), and (match X with (($1 $1 --) --)) as (CDAR X).  Note that you can explicitly insert LISTP checks yourself by using @, as described below, e.g., (match X with (($1 $1 --)@LISTP --)) translates as (CDR (LISTP (CAR X))).Note:  The insertion of LISTP checks for elements is controlled by the variable PATLISTPCHECK.  When PATLISTPCHECK is T, LISTP checks are inserted, e.g., (match X with (('A --) --)) translates as: (EQ (CAR (LISTP (CAR (LISTP X)))) 'A).  PATLISTPCHECK is initially NIL.  Its value can be changed within a particular function by using a local CLISP declaration (see the Declarations section of Chapter 21).Note:  Pattern match expressions are translated using the DWIM and CLISP facilities, using all CLISP declarations in effect (standard/fast/undoable) (see the Declarations section of Chapter 21).Pattern ElementsA pattern consists of a list of pattern elements.  Each pattern element is said to match either an element of a data structure or a segment.  For example, in the editor's pattern matcher, ª--º (see the Commands That Search section of Chapter 16) matches any arbitrary segment of a list, while & or a subpattern match only one element of a list.  Those patterns which may match a segment of a list are called segment patterns; those that match a single element are called element patterns.Element PatternsThere are several types of element patterns, best given by their syntax:	$1 or &	Matches an arbitrary element of a list.	'EXPRESSION	Matches only an element which is equal to the given expression e.g., 'A, '(A B).		EQ, MEMB, and ASSOC are automatically used in the translation when the quoted expression is atomic, otherwise EQUAL, MEMBER, and SASSOC.	=FORM	Matches only an element which is EQUAL to the value of FORM, e.g., =X, =(REVERSE Y).	==FORM	Same as =, but uses an EQ check instead of EQUAL.	ATOM	The treatment depends on setting of PATVARDEFAULT.  If PATVARDEFAULT is ' or QUOTE, same as 'ATOM.  If PATVARDEFAULT is = or EQUAL, same as =ATOM.  If PATVARDEFAULT is == or EQ, same as ==ATOM.  If PATVARDEFAULT is ¬ or SETQ, same as ATOM¬&.  PATVARDEFAULT is initially '.		PATVARDEFAULT can be changed within a particular function by using a local CLISP declaration (see Chapter 21).		Numbers and strings are always interpreted as though PATVARDEFAULT were =, regardless of its setting.  EQ, MEMB, and ASSOC are used for comparisons involving small integers.	(PATTERN1 ... PATTERNN)	Matches a list which matches the given patterns, e.g., (& &), (-- 'A).	ELEMENT-PATTERN@FN	Matches an element if ELEMENT-PATTERN matches it, and FN (name of a function or a LAMBDA expression) applied to that element returns non-NIL.  For example, &@NUMBERP matches a number and ('A --)@FOO matches a list whose first element is A, and for which FOO applied to that list is non-NIL.		For ªsimpleº tests, the function-object is applied before a match is attempted with the pattern, e.g., ((-- 'A --)@LISTP --) translates as (AND  (LISTP (CAR X)) (MEMB 'A (CAR X))), not the other way around.  FN may also be a FORM in terms of the variable @, e.g., &@(EQ @ 3) is equivalent to =3.	*	Matches any arbitrary element.  If the entire match succeeds, the element which matched the * will be returned as the value of the match.		Normally, the pattern match compiler constructs an expression whose value is guaranteed to be non-NIL if the match succeeds and NIL if it fails.  However, if a * appears in the pattern, the expression generated could also return NIL if the match succeeds and * was matched to NIL.  For example, (match X with ('A * --)) translates as (AND (EQ (CAR X) 'A) (CADR X)), so if X is equal to (A NIL B) then (match X with ('A * --)) returns NIL even though the match succeeded.	~ELEMENT-PATTERN	Matches an element if the element is not matched by ELEMENT-PATTERN, e.g.,  ~'A, ~=X, ~(-- 'A --).	(*ANY* ELEMENT-PATTERN ELEMENT-PATTERN ...)			Matches if any of the contained patterns match.Segment Patterns	$ or --	Matches any segment of a list (including one of zero length).		The difference between $ and -- is in the type of search they generate.  For example, (match X with ($ 'A 'B $)) translates as (EQ (CADR (MEMB 'A X)) 'B), whereas (match X with (-- 'A 'B $)) translates as:		[SOME X (FUNCTION (LAMBDA ($$2 $$1)		  (AND (EQ $$2 'A)		       (EQ (CADR $$1) 'B]		Thus, a paraphrase of ($ 'A 'B $) would be ªIs the element following the first A a B?º, whereas a paraphrase of (-- 'A 'B $) would be ªIs there any A immediately followed by a B?º Note that the pattern employing $ will result in a more efficient search than that employing --.  However, ($ 'A 'B $) will not match with (X Y Z A M O A B C), but (-- 'A 'B $) will.		Essentially, once a pattern following a $ matches, the $ never resumes searching, whereas -- produces a translation that will always continue searching until there is no possibility of success.  However, if the pattern match compiler can deduce from the pattern that continuing a search after a particular failure cannot possibly succeed, then the translations for both -- and $ will be the same.  For example, both (match X with ($ 'A $3 $)) and (match X with (-- 'A $3 --)) translate as (CDDDR (MEMB (QUOTE A) X)), because if there are not three elements following the first A, there certainly will not be three elements following subsequent A's, so there is no reason to continue searching, even for --.  Similarly, ($ 'A $ 'B $) and (-- 'A -- 'B --) are equivalent.	$2, $3, etc.	Matches a segment of the given length.  $1 is not a segment pattern.	!ELEMENT-PATTERN	Matches any segment which ELEMENT-PATTERN would match as a list.  For example, if the value of FOO is (A B C), !=FOO will match the segment ... A B C ... etc.		Note:  Since ! appearing in front of the last pattern specifies a match with some tail of the given expression, it also makes sense in this case for a ! to appear in front of a pattern that can only match with an atom, e.g., ($2 !'A) means match if CDDR of the expression is the atom A.  Similarly, (match X with ($ ! 'A)) translates to (EQ (CDR (LAST X)) 'A).	!ATOM	treatment depends on setting of PATVARDEFAULT. If PATVARDEFAULT is ' or QUOTE, same as !'ATOM (see above discussion).  If PATVARDEFAULT is = or EQUAL, same as !=ATOM.  If PATVARDEFAULT is == or EQ, same as !==ATOM.  If PATVARDEFAULT is ¬ or SETQ, same as ATOM¬$.	.	The atom ª.º is treated exactly like ª!º.  In addition, if a pattern ends in an atom, the ª.º is first changed to ª!º, e.g., ($1 . A) and ($1 ! A) are equivalent, even though the atom ª.º does not explicitly appear in the pattern.		One exception where ª.º is not treated like ª!º:   ª.º preceding an assignment does not have the special interpretation that ª!º has preceding an assignment (see below).  For example, (match X with ('A . FOO¬'B)) translates as:		(AND (EQ (CAR X) 'A)			 	(EQ (CDR X) 'B)					(SETQ FOO (CDR X)))		but (match X with ('A ! FOO¬'B)) translates as:		(AND (EQ (CAR X) 'A)				(NULL (CDDR X)				(EQ (CADR X) 'B)					(SETQ FOO (CDR X)))	SEGMENT-PATTERN@FUNCTION-OBJECT 			Matches a segment if the segment-pattern matches it, and the function object applied to the corresponding segment (as a list) returns non-NIL.  For example, ($@CDDR 'D $) matches (A B C D E) but not (A B D E), since CDDR of (A B) is NIL.		An @ pattern applied to a segment will require computing the corresponding structure (with LDIFF) each time the predicate is applied (except when the segment in question is a tail of the list being matched).AssignmentsAny pattern element may be preceded by ªVARIABLE¬º, meaning that if the match succeeds (i.e., everything matches), VARIABLE is to be set to the thing that matches that pattern element.  For example, if X is (A B C D E), (match X with ($2 Y¬$3)) will set Y to (C D E).  Note that assignments are not performed until the entire match has succeeded, so assignments cannot be used to specify a search for an element found earlier in the match, e.g., (match X with (Y¬$1 =Y --)) will not match with (A A B C ...), unless, of course, the value of Y was A before the match started.  This type of match is achieved by using place-markers, described below.If the variable is preceded by a !, the assignment is to the tail of the list as of that point in the pattern, i.e., that portion of the list matched by the remainder of the pattern.  For example, if X is (A B C D E), (match X with ($ !Y¬'C 'D $)) sets Y to (C D E), i.e., CDDR of X.  In other words, when ! precedes an assignment, it acts as a modifier to the ¬, and has no effect whatsoever on the pattern itself, e.g., (match X with ('A 'B)) and (match X with ('A !FOO¬'B)) match identically, and in the latter case, FOO will be set to CDR of X.Note:  *¬PATTERN-ELEMENT and !*¬PATTERN-ELEMENT are acceptable, e.g., (match X with ($ 'A *¬('B --) --)) translates as:[PROG ($$2) (RETURN (AND (EQ (CAADR (SETQ $$2 (MEMB 'A X)))  'B)      (CADR $$2]Place-MarkersVariables of the form #N, N a number, are called place-markers, and are interpreted specially by the pattern match compiler.  Place-markers are used in a pattern to mark or refer to a particular pattern element.  Functionally, they are used like ordinary variables, i.e., they can be assigned values, or used freely in forms appearing in the pattern, e.g., (match X with (#1¬$1 =(ADD1 #1))) will match the list (2 3).  However, they are not really variables in the sense that they are not bound, nor can a function called from within the pattern expect to be able to obtain their values.  For convenience, regardless of the setting of PATVARDEFAULT, the first appearance of a defaulted place-marker is interpreted as though PATVARDEFAULT were ¬.  Thus the above pattern could have been written as (match X with ( 1 =(ADD1  1))).  Subsequent appearances of a place-marker are interpreted as though PATVARDEFAULT were =.  For example, (match X with (#1 #1 --)) is equivalent to (match X with (#1¬$1 =#1 --)), and translates as (AND (CDR X) (EQUAL (CAR X) (CADR X)).  Note that (EQUAL (CAR X) (CADR X)) would incorrectly match with (NIL).ReplacementsThe construct PATTERN-ELEMENT¬FORM specifies that if the match succeeds, the part of the data that matched is to be replaced with the value of FORM.  For example, if X =(A B C D E), (match X with ($ 'C $1¬Y $1)) will replace the third element of X with the value of Y.  As with assignments, replacements are not performed until after it is determined that the entire match will be successful.Replacements involving segments splice the corresponding structure into the list being matched, e.g., if X is (A B C D E F) and FOO is (1 2 3), after the pattern ('A $¬FOO 'D $) is matched with X, X will be (A 1 2 3 D E F), and FOO will be EQ to CDR of X, i.e., (1 2 3 D E F).Note that ($ FOO¬FIE $) is ambiguous, since it is not clear whether FOO or FIE is the pattern element, i.e., whether ¬ specifies assignment or replacement.  For example, if PATVARDEFAULT is =, this pattern can be interpreted as ($ FOO¬=FIE $), meaning search for the value of FIE, and if found set FOO to it, or ($ =FOO¬FIE $) meaning search for the value of FOO, and if found, store the value of FIE into the corresponding position.  In such cases, you should disambiguate by not using the PATVARDEFAULT option, i.e., by specifying ' or =.Note:  Replacements are normally done with RPLACA or RPLACD.  The user can specify that /RPLACA and /RPLACD should be used, or FRPLACA and FRPLACD, by means of CLISP declarations (see Chapter 21).ReconstructionThe user can specify a value for a pattern match operation other than what is returned by the match by writing (match FORM1 with PATTERN => FORM2).  For example, (match X with (FOO¬$ 'A --) => (REVERSE FOO)) translates as:[PROG ($$2)   (RETURN      (COND ((SETQ $$2 (MEMB 'A X))             (SETQ FOO (LDIFF X $2))             (REVERSE FOO]Place-markers in the pattern can be referred to from within FORM, e.g., the above could also have been written as (match X with (!#1 'A --) => (REVERSE #1)).  If -> is used in place of =>, the expression being matched is also physically changed to the value of FORM.  For example, (match X with (#1 'A !#2) -> (CONS #1 #2)) would remove the second element from X, if it were equal to A.In general, (match FORM1 with PATTERN -> FORM2) is translated so as to compute FORM2 if the match is successful, and then smash its value into the first node of FORM1.  However, whenever possible, the translation does not actually require FORM2 to be computed in its entirety, but instead the pattern match compiler uses FORM2 as an indication of what should be done to FORM1.  For example, (match X with (#1 'A !#2) -> (CONS #1 #2)) translates as (AND (EQ (CADR X) 'A) (RPLACD X (CDDR X))).ExamplesExample: (match X with (-- 'A --))-- matches any arbitrary segment.  'A matches only an A, and the second -- again matches an arbitrary segment; thus this translates to (MEMB 'A X).Example: (match X with (-- 'A))Again, -- matches an arbitrary segment; however, since there is no -- after the 'A, A must be the last element of X.  Thus this translates to: (EQ (CAR (LAST X)) 'A).Example: (match X with ('A 'B -- 'C $3 --))CAR of X must be A, and CADR must be B, and there must be at least three elements after the first C, so the translation is:(AND (EQ (CAR X) 'A)     (EQ (CADR X) 'B)     (CDDDR (MEMB 'C (CDDR X))))Example: (match X with (('A 'B) 'C Y_$1 $))Since ('A 'B) does not end in $ or --, (CDDAR X) must be NIL.  The translation is:(COND   ((AND (EQ (CAAR X) 'A)         (EQ (CADAR X) 'B)         (NULL (CDDAR X))         (EQ (CADR X) 'C)         (CDDR X))    (SETQ Y (CADDR X))    T))Example: (match X with (#1 'A $ 'B 'C #1 $))#1 is implicitly assigned to the first element in the list.  The $ searches for the first B following A.  This B must be followed by a C, and the C by an expression equal to the first element.  The translation is:[PROG ($$2)(RETURN  (AND (EQ (CADR X) 'A)    (EQ [CADR (SETQ $$2 (MEMB 'B (CDDR X] 'C)      (CDDR $$2)        (EQUAL (CADDR $$2) (CAR X]Example: (match X with (#1 'A -- 'B 'C #1 $))Similar to the pattern above, except that -- specifies a search for any B followed by a C followed by the first element, so the translation is:[AND (EQ (CADR X) 'A)  (SOME (CDDR X)        (FUNCTION (LAMBDA ($$2 $$1)           (AND (EQ $$2 'B)                (EQ (CADR $$1) 'C)		      (CDDR $$1)				(EQUAL (CADDR $$1) (CAR X]       /  °                                   ,  °                                 5   ®°        ¢ ®                              5   ®°       ¢ ®                              5   ®°      ¢ ®                              0  È                          T         / H HÈ                                    , N NÈ                                   , H HÈ                                  /  °                                   0    È 
