The followingbug reports resulted:1. The load sequence is flaky in that some file tries to advise BSPSOUT   before BSP is loaded.2. If an error occurs during initialization (e.g. b/c the users mailboxes   are on MAXC) the error msg is directed to a non-existent window and therefore   never appears.3. There is no reason why a user should not be able to use Lafite to send   mail even if his mailboxes are not accessible to read it. The above    error effectively prevents this. Second, when Dick bypassed this and   unearthed the internal msg sending entry, it's first action was to   try to log me in, whereupon it took the same error.   There MUST be a simple functional SNDMSG entry which does not have these   dependencies (e.g. for use for bug reporting by users who may have no   priviledges wrt Grapevine whatsoever).BeauPS: One of the Lafite internal functions binds a clear text version of the    user's password on the stack.

As far as I can tell, what you are doing is writing a scratch file consisting of the compacted mail file, then performing a RENAMEFILE of that to the original mail file. Sad to say, RENAMEFILE is SLOW--it is implemented by copying the file and deleting the source.Even if RENAMEFILE were implemented "correctly" (and on {DSK} this would still take time proportional to the length of the file and leave the file in a terrible state in the event of a crash) this method still takes time proportional to the length of the mail file, not to what logically changed.  For example, to delete the last message of a mail file, I should not have to do much more than truncate the file, not copy the whole file once, much less twice! The algorithm I was expecting to see (and was disappointed not to find) was that compacting a mail file consists of writing a scratch file consisting of the messages in the mail file starting after the first deleted message, then copying the scratch file onto the old mail file starting at the first deleted message, then truncating the mail file.  This does leave the mail file in a temporarily bad state if you crashed in the middle (there would be some message of bad length, but all the undeleted messages would still be there available for a mailfilescavenger to pick up), but RENAMEFILE would not do a whole lot better.	Bill*start*00495 00024 US Date: 21-MAR-83 10:23:21 PDTFrom: Yonke.PASubject: Gross Lafite bugsIn-reply-to: vanMelle.PA's message of 16-MAR-83 15:19:41 PDTTo: vanMelle.PAcc: Yonke"Sending while sending" bug  has been "fixed" so that you can't do it -- the better fix is to "stack up" sending processes.

Can you get back in that state when I'm around to take a look-see?Martin*start*00978 00024 US Date: 28-MAR-83 16:59:47 PDTFrom: vanMelle.PASubject: Re: Other Form not implementedIn-reply-to: Yonke.PA's message of 28-MAR-83 16:14:42 PDTTo: Yonke.PAcc: vanMelle.PAI tried reproducing it and hit a different bug instead.  When it asked for a file, I gave {DSK}FOO.TXT, which provoked an error FILE NOT FOUND {DSK}<VANMELLE>FOO.TXT.  MAILSENDER was thus aborted, but Lafite still thought I was sending mail, so wouldn't let me send more.  [Dick told me about !!CURRENTLYSENDING!!, which is how I manage to be sending now.]I think when I originally had the error, LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&DIR was {DSK} (and the saved file was also on {DSK}), and it is even conceivable that between the time I saved it and the time I sent it I had changed it to {PHYLUM}<VANMELLE>, if this helps your search any.Incidentally, Answer doesn't seem to suppress duplicates even when they are exactly duplicate (this message originally had a cc: Yonke.PA on it).	Bill*start*00605 00024 US Date: 29-Mar-83 10:12:31 PST (Tuesday)From: pipes.paSubject: Mr. Msg system...To: Yonkecc: this is just part of a long exchange.  as I've said before, it sure would be nice...In-reply-to: GYoung's message of 29-Mar-83  9:28:36 PST (Tuesday)To: GYoungcc: pipesUsing the delete button is a fine idea.  Just so happens that it doesn't offer enough options.  Be nice if there was a "Del From:GYoung - Return, Not read, Not interested.  If assholes who abuse the msg system got their "shit" thrown back at 'em, maybe then they would learn not to throw so much out./jp*start*01241 00024 US Date: 29-MAR-83 12:29:04 PDTFrom: BURTON.PASubject: Tedit mail interactionTo: Sybalskycc: Yonke.PA, LispSupport.PALafite-System-Date: 18-MAR-83 15:34:01I ran into an interaction between tedit and lafite.  I typed a message that had a piece of lisp code in it.  Before I sent the message I wanted to try the code so I returned to the tty window and tried to shift-select the code from Tedit.  This didn't work (John I thought this was near the top of the list?) but did leave the selection associated with the window somehow.  I then typed in the code and it did what I thought so I buttoned Deliver.  This didn't do anything because the Tedit window didn't have control.  When I gave it control by buttoning in it, the code I had selected earlier got inserted where I had buttoned and the message was immediately sent!  I think the selections should be flushed if they aren't inserted into the tty buffer.Richardps. John: the sequence {large amount of typing}, undo, {small number of characters typed} causes {large amount of typing} to be lost; or at least I don't know how to get it back.  Laurel keeps two buffers and undo switches between them until there is a mouse action.  This is a better choice.*start*00463 00024 US Date: 29-MAR-83 14:07:32 PDTFrom: Yonke.PATo: BURTON.PASubject: [BURTON.PA: >>Subject<<]cc: Yonke.PADate: 27-MAR-83 17:29:36 PDTFrom: BURTON.PAWhen I move the browser window, it still loses its right margin characteristic so that I get garbage in the first columns of the next line.----------You're right but I don't understand why MOVE should change the DS right margin -- I understand why SHAPE should, but MOVE?  Oh well.
