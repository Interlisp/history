It told me I had new mail, so I bugged "new mail".  It said retrieving 2 messages from Semillon, but then put nothing into my Active.mail.My initial placement of windows was such that the Browser overlapped my tty window.  As a result, I had a hard time bugging menu items, because there is no way to bring the Browser to the top and keep it there.  This isn't really your bug; more like a standard window system aggravation.Sometimes Lafite fails to switch the right-facing arrow that comes up in the Browser margin back to the default cursor when the cursor moves out of the margin; sometimes even after the cursor is entirely out of the Browser window.I find in using Laurel and Hardy that it is nice that both of those systems display in a fixed area the news "You have new mail" or "Mailbox empty at <time>".  This makes it easy to tell at a glance whether there is new mail, and how recently it was checked for if there isn't.  Doing this in the promptwindow seems a loss.  If you put the main Lafite menu in a horizontal menu, it could perch nicely on top of your first Browser window, and have a well-defined space for this notification.	Bill*start*00376 00024 US Date: 12-JAN-83 12:55:34 PDTFrom: vanMelle.PASubject: More LafiteTo: Yonkecc: vanMelle.PAIn fact, it would be nice to have a status line or two for more than just the new mail status; all of the things that go to the Promptwindow now would be nicer put in a place associated with Lafite.

I see no particular reason for Lafite not to just keep the file open for write the first time it decides to open for write (e.g. if you were just reading mail, you might never open the file for write, but as soon as you did a new mail you would change state; makes no difference on DSK, except for the matter of the file's write date, but it would make a big difference reading public mail files on a file server).  Then whenever you otherwise would have said to close the file, just perform a (FLUSHMAP stream) to get the dirty pages written out but not close the file.	Bill*start*00316 00024 US Date: 14-MAR-83 14:35:07 PDTFrom: vanMelle.PASubject: ExpungeTo: Yonkecc: vanMelle.PAI don't see any command that rewrites a message file without quitting the browser.

As far as I can tell, what you are doing is writing a scratch file consisting of the compacted mail file, then performing a RENAMEFILE of that to the original mail file. Sad to say, RENAMEFILE is SLOW--it is implemented by copying the file and deleting the source.Even if RENAMEFILE were implemented "correctly" (and on {DSK} this would still take time proportional to the length of the file and leave the file in a terrible state in the event of a crash) this method still takes time proportional to the length of the mail file, not to what logically changed.  For example, to delete the last message of a mail file, I should not have to do much more than truncate the file, not copy the whole file once, much less twice! The algorithm I was expecting to see (and was disappointed not to find) was that compacting a mail file consists of writing a scratch file consisting of the messages in the mail file starting after the first deleted message, then copying the scratch file onto the old mail file starting at the first deleted message, then truncating the mail file.  This does leave the mail file in a temporarily bad state if you crashed in the middle (there would be some message of bad length, but all the undeleted messages would still be there available for a mailfilescavenger to pick up), but RENAMEFILE would not do a whole lot better.	Bill*start*00494 00024 US Date: 21-MAR-83 10:23:21 PDTFrom: Yonke.PASubject: Gross Lafite bugsIn-reply-to: vanMelle.PA's message of 16-MAR-83 15:19:41 PDTTo: vanMelle.PAcc: Yonke"Sending while sending" bug  has been "fixed" so that you can't do it -- the better fix is to "stack up" sending processes.

It started by Active.mail truely having a bad mail file format -- there were 23 nulls at the end of the legitmate messages and we should talk about how it got in that state (is it possible the filesystem might have done this?).  By the way, I fixed your badactive.mail and it's in my directory as vanmelle.mail.  I don't know how you got out of the error, but at the end it thought your mail file name was NIL (how did you "invoke Lafite again"?).  Because the mail file name was NIL, when you called 'Quit' Lafite generated a file name ".NIL-LAFITE-TOC;1" (my bug) which unfortunately Interlisp-D was happy to create (isn't this a bug?  on no other implementation of Interlisp can you open a file with a null NAME).  Anyway, you found someplaces where Lafite should be more careful, but as I said they've always been there.  There still is the question of how active.mail  got clobbered and I'll come to talk to you about that.Thanks for the report.Martin*start*00756 00024 US Date: 11-APR-83 17:00:31 PDTFrom: Yonke.PASubject: Re: Newest Lafite badly damagedIn-reply-to: vanMelle.PA's message of 10-APR-83 12:28:02 PDTTo: vanMelle.PAcc: Yonke.PA, LispSupport.PAThere is a new Lafite on Fugue which fixes your problems.  The problem happened because if file F is opened for output and you do 	(SETFILEINFO F 'LENGTH 100)	(CLOSEF F)then (GETFILEINFO F 'LENGTH) will be 100 if the filepointer was less than 100.  If the filepointer was greater than 100 then the LENGTH is the filepointer and everthing between 100 and the filepointer has been zeroed out.  This is how the bad formated mail file was generated.I consider this a bug in the filesystem, but I have programmed around it for now.Martin*start*00774 00024 US Date: 14-Apr-83 14:28:35 pdtFrom: vanMelle.PASubject: new LafiteTo: Yonke.PAcc: vanMelle.PALafite-System-Date: 13-Apr-83 16:53:18 pdt1.  When starting up, message selector is not placed at the first unexamined message (or last message), but rather the first.  After Get Mail, the pointer also moves back to message 1.2.  The Lafite status window is getting a little wide, although I do like "Message Form" better than "Send Mail".3.  The submenu entry "Another Form" might better be called "Other Form", lest one confuse it with having two regular forms up at once.4.  (Old gripe)  The message selector cursor has its hotspot in a funny place (somewhere in the middle).  I would have expected it to be at the point of the arrow.	Bill*start*00677 00024 US Date: 14-Apr-83 16:55:59 pdtFrom: vanMelle.PASubject: more bugsTo: Yonke.PAcc: vanMelle.PALafite-System-Date: 14-Apr-83 13:22:58 pdtI did a quit earlier today, which updated (I think) but did not close my mail file.

The name of said file, of course, would have to be readily visible somewhere.

That may be fine for the user who always reads messages sequentially, but lousy if one tends to skip messages.  I think Laurel and Hardy always place the selector at the first new message.  The latter scheme seems better than the former, since presumably I bugged GetMail hoping to actually read the new mail.  The former seems to win only in the case where I bugged GetMail before finishing up my old messages (perhaps I wanted to empty out my mailbox for other reasons).  If this seems an important case, you might compromise by moving the selector to the first unexamined message that is "contiguous" with the new messages (i.e. start at the first new message and go backwards until you run into an examined message).	Bill*start*00722 00024 US Date: 17-May-83 11:54 PDTFrom: Yonke.PASubject: new LafiteTo: LispSupport.PALisp-System-Date: 17-MAY-83 10:01:21There is a new Lafite on {Phlyum}<lispcore>sources>lafite.dcom.

The black bar (an icon which replaces the window title) actually is informative.  The title says something like "Message sent:  x Recipients".  This was a first pass about what to do when you have multiple sending windows (in which case the printing in the status window wouldn't tell you which message was being talked about).  Larry has had some suggestions concerning this "interface" (e.g. srinking to a more graphical icon).  Also, if I just closed the window you couldn't get the window back (the icon gives you a handle on it).  I'm willing to take suggestions on a better interface from all.2.) This (leaving a horizontal menu after closing the browser) is fixed in the next Lafite (it was a bad interaction between Lafite and MenuedWindow).3.)  This is a more serious problem.  The ultimate solution is to have "panes" (ala SmallTalk) or something else that associate multiple "windows" with one window.  I may come up with an adhoc solution, but we all should be thinking of a design for the solution.  Sorry, this one won't be fixed soon.MartinP.S.

This should vastly improve reliability.-  Almost everything runs under a separate process, so you hardly every need to wait for Lafite to finish a task.-  'Move To' now has an "accelerator" so that if you middle button 'Move To' and you have already moved some messges, it will move the messages to the same file, without confirmation.  (The file name for the MoveTo is printed in the title bar of the browser window.)-  You can now have multiple sending windows active at one time.  The only trick you need to know is that the message window must have the "tty process" in order for the 'Deliver', etc. commands to take effect.-  There are two new variables: LAFITEUSEHIGHESTVERSIONFLG and LAFITEDISPLAYDELETEDMESSAGEFLG.

What happened was that I had two browsers, each of which did a Display in close succession; the first because I clicked Display and the other because I had done a Move or Delete that caused the next message to get displayed on finishing the command.  Thus, the display of the first message was rudely overwritten by the second.  Probably each browser should have its own display window.2.  I am happy for you to uppercase names AFTER you have opened the file.  It just would have been nice to be able to type a name in mixed case and get the (new) file created with that name.  I can see you might have a small problem with determining that the name I typed was not the name of a mail file you already had open, but that seems less pervasive than your response suggests.By the way, have you thought of incorporating Larry's suggestion that the MoveTo confirm prompt include a [Old File] or [New File] as appropriate for filenames that the user types in?	Bill *start*00831 00024 US Date:  6 Jul 83 22:33 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Hardcopy thoughtsTo: Yonkecc: vanMelle.paTwo things; any thoughts on these?1.

In a similar waste of paper, I often find myself doing several hardcopies as I march thru a mail file.  Not only does this waste more paper, and produce shorter listings that are more likely to be misfiled, but I also have to wait for each one (I assume I can't just plunge ahead).

The following is not conclusively funny (pasadena may have been doing something odd), but it seemed a striking coincidence.  Enclosed find what are now messages 189, 233 and 242.  Message 189 and 242 are nearly the same; both are in reply to message 233, which appears grossly out of chronological order (dated 29 Jul, it is among the Aug 1 messages).  However, there are no messages from Pasadena in between 189 and 233, so there may simply have been a gateway down at a critical moment.  The interesting coincidence is that one of message 189 or 242 is the one that was broken.  Looking at file pointers, I think it was 242, which starts at 204011, a more familiar-looking file pointer than 157189.  Further tidbit: I strongly suspect I deleted message 242, thinking it a duplicate.	Bill     ----- Fowarded Messages -----Date: Fri, 29 Jul 83 16:33 PDTFrom: raim.pasaSubject: Re: Problem Report P1157 (Sysout Fails)In-reply-to: "Kocher's message of Fri, 29 Jul 83 16:07 PDT"To: 1100Support.eoscc: LispSupport.pa, Kocher.pasaChris,We are in the process of finalizing a maintenance rlease of Fugue.

I had a consistent vmem, though, so I resumed it.  Lafite observed that my active.mail had changed, so it told me it was reparsing it.  When it finished, it put up a null table of contents (I had had 93 messages before).  I tried closing the window and browsing active afresh, but Lafite just put the same (apparently cached) window back up.The browser window has properties CURRENTMESSAGENUMBERS = (93) and LAFITEDATA = ({PHYLUM}<VANMELLE>ACTIVE.MAIL;1 5 101178 NIL).  My ACTIVE.MAIL is 107520 bytes long.I eventually recovered by breaking COMPACTMAILFILE, then closing the window with an Update&Close.  I returned out of the COMPACTMAILFILE, then rebrowsed active.  It complained it couldn't parse it.  This because of a partial message at the end; I truncated the file back to where it was before the getmail (101178), and everything seems to be fine now.	Bill*start*01412 00024 US Date: 16 Aug 83 15:19 PDTFrom: Stansbury.paSubject: Move To bugTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Stansbury.paLafite-System-Date: 22 Jul 83 15:58 PDTI just attempted to move message 1 of my active3.mail to my misc.mail.  While the transfer was in progress, I accidentally left-buttoned message 2.  When the transfer was done, active3's browser indicated that message 2 had been moved, not message 1.  I checked misc.mail, and lo and behold, message 2 of active3 was there.  This strikes me as somewhat of a non-feature.  Since you already verify that the move-to is desired, I don't see any particular reason why the user would want to change the move in mid-course.  Would it not be possible to lock out selections while the move is going on?That's not the bug yet, though.  I went on to undo the MoveTo mixup, read active3's messages 3 & 4 and MoveTo them to misc.mail.  But then when I read active3's message 5, it contained the first 3/4 of the message that had been mistakenly transfered to misc, and message 6 contained the last 1/4 plus the last few characters of its original contents.  Yuk!I don't know whether this happened during the original mistaken transfer of message 2 or in transfering it back.  Transfering it back seemed to have worked at least partially correctly, since it was in fact intact at the end of active3.Hope this all makes sense.-- Tayloe.*start*00647 00024 US Date: 17 Aug 83 22:22 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: more on my mail file crazinessTo: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 22 Jul 83 15:58 PDTThe message BEFORE the one whose count was 2 too large had a count that was, technically, 2 too small.

Besides fixing bugs, its main observable differences are:After sending a message, the sending window shrinks to a "cancelled envelope" icon with the # of recipients in the address field.You can now shrink  any browser window, and it will shrink to a "manilla folder" with the name of the message folder in it.There is now a 'SendMail' menu item in the background menu.  Even if Lafite is not running (i.e. there is now main Lafite status window), you can still send a message by buttoning this menu item (or explicitly calling the function SENDMAIL).  This gives you a "low overhead" method of sending messages without envoking all of Lafite.If you want messages sent by you to be automatically considered "seen" by Lafite for you, then set the variable LAFITEIFFROMMETHENSEENFLG to T (the current default).  Note:  you may want to change to value of LAFITEDISPLAYAFTERDELETEFLG to ALWAYS.If you want the to field in the browser window to be truncated in the browser window to what "fits" in the area rather than pushing the subject field further to the right, set the variable LAFITETRUNCATEFROMFIELDFLG to T (the current default).Retrieve mail status messages now appear in a window above the browser they are going into rather than the promptwindow.  This window is also used to asked about the file you want messages moved to using the 'Move To' command.As usual, suggestions and bug reports welcome.MartinP.S.

However, I plan to do this soon.  In looking at the current code there are two possible interfaces for sending messages you created yourself.  One takes a text stream as the message, parses it to find the recipients and sends the message.  The other takes a text stream and a list of recipients, doesn't parse the message but sends it to the list of recipients -- useful if you aren't following the header conventions in the message body.  Neither of these have been "ruggedized" for external use and I would like to do that before "releasing" them.  This is simple.Its a bit trickier for giving you a handle onto incoming messages and not degrade the performance for everyone else who is not using this feature at the same time.  My current inclination is to have another definition of RETRIEVEMESSAGES that you can load on top of standard Lafite.  Then for each message recieved I would parse the header and call a user function with a stream and a list in property list format of all the fields in the header with their values being objects of the right type (e.g. strings for Subject:, but a list of addresses for To:).  The value returned from the user function would say whether to put the message in the default mail folder or that the function took care of the message (of course I also have to create an interface to allow you to put the message in a arbitrary folder the "correct" way).  Suggestions are welcome concerning the handling of income messages since this has not been written yet.This should all happen in a week or two.Martin*start*00887 00024 US Date: Fri, 23 Sep 83 16:39 PDTFrom: Bobrow.PASubject: Re: How do I get inside LafiteIn-reply-to: "Yonke's message of 22 Sep 83 11:50 PDT"To: Yonkecc: Bobrow, LispSupportI would be glad to try Sending using a text stream as a message, let you parse it to find the recipients and send the message. -- especially since I see I can easily create the text streams.To get a handle on receiving, what would be reasonable would be to start with a folder (say active.Mail, or any other) and have a way of obtaining the NTH message as a TESTOBJ (I can coerce it to a string if I want), storing a string in a folder as a message, and moving the NTH message from one folder to another.  It seems that all these functions must be there, and what I need is documentation.

Please let's have the cache checked before its info is used!Beau *start*00490 00024 US Date: 27 Sep 83 10:05 PDTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Lafite: MOVE-TO glitchTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Kaplan.paLafite-System-Date: 20 Sep 83 13:21 PDTLisp-System-Date: 24-SEP-83 12:38:39Whenever I use the middlebutton to move-to a file that I have moved-to before, I get a message in the prompt window"Leaf error: 111 File open in conflicting way - file busy"A few seconds after this, the move-to button greys out and the move seems to take place.--Ron*start*00721 00024 US Date: 27 Sep 83 13:19 PDTFrom: Yonke.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Change of user via LOGINIn-reply-to: Sheil.pa's message of 26 Sep 83 14:41 PDTTo: Sheil.pacc: Yonke.pa, LispSupport.paThere have been similar discussions before (but in the context of where should mail "go" after something is changed by LOGIN) and we never came to a good conclusion because of various opinions of what LOGIN really means on a personal machine.Larry has already suggested allowing "login data" to have user properties (e.g. Lafite's properties) and your case the new LOGIN would have cleared the cache.  I vote for this one.  The only other solution is for Lafite to advise LOGIN (not a pleasant idea).Martin*start*00668 00024 US Date: 28 Sep 83 09:54 PDTFrom: sheil.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Change of user via LOGINIn-reply-to: Yonke.pa's message of 27 Sep 83 13:19 PDTTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.paI understand the confusion about where mail should "go" after something is changed by LOGIN.  Given the conflicting opinions, I agree that we can punt on this for a while.However, having Lafite confused (and unconfusable without brain surgery) about whose mail is to be READ, is much more deadly.While the debate about the semantics of LOGIN rages, PLEASE advise it to clear the Lafite cache. That's a great deal more pleasant than having mailboxes trashed!Beau*start*00546 00024 US Date: 28 SEP 83 11:17 PDTFrom: KAPLAN.PASubject: Re: Lafite: Change of user via LOGINTo:   sheil, Yonkecc:   LispSupportIn response to the message sent  28 Sep 83 09:54 PDT from sheil.paTo raise the earlier issue:Let's not confuse GREET with LOGIN.  If you really want to change your user identity, then re-GREET yourself.  If you merely want to obtain different access privileges, then LOGIN.  I suppose that GREET should automatically force the user's generic login.  That might help to clarify things.--Ron*start*00873 00024 US Date: 28 Sep 83 12:39 PDTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Change of user via LOGINIn-reply-to: KAPLAN.PA's message of 28 SEP 83 11:17 PDTTo: KAPLAN.PAcc: Yonke.PA, LispSupport.PAI really don't want to take (or wait for) a position on the issue of what is the right way to reidentify oneself.However, LOGIN sure LOOKS like the way one reidentifies yourself. It's what happens on return from a LOGOUT and it sets the USERNAME. To a naive user like me, the change in USERNAME makes me think I've reidentified myself (which is to say nothing about what directory I might be connected to and sundry other GREETy issues).But, let me state the problem more succinctly:Lafite does something to establish its cache of info about whose mail it is dealing with. That cache is currently preserved when the USERNAME changes, which is wrong.Beau*start*00333 00024 US Date: 28 Sep 83 16:52 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: Forward loses only somewhatTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 27 Sep 83 14:24 PDTLisp-System-Date: 27-SEP-83 19:52:39It leaves behind an open file {CORE}TEDITINCLUDE.TEMP, even after the message is delivered or aborted.	Bill*start*00265 00024 USaDate: 28 Sep 83 17:41 PDTFrom: Sybalsky.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Forward loses only somewhatIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 28 Sep 83 16:52 PDTTo: vanMelle.pacc: Yonke.pa, LispSupport.paYou can have safety, or you can have space.*start*00289 00024 US Date: 28 Sep 83 19:06 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Forward loses only somewhatIn-reply-to: Sybalsky.pa's message of 28 Sep 83 17:41 PDTTo: Sybalsky.pacc: vanMelle.pa, Yonke.pa, LispSupport.paWhy can't I have both by you using {NODIRCORE}?	Bill*start*00474 00024 US Date: 29 Sept. 1983 11:27 am PDT (Thursday)From: Sybalsky.PASubject: Re: Lafite: Forward loses only somewhatIn-reply-to: vanMelle's message of 28 Sep 83 19:06 PDTTo: vanMellecc: Sybalsky, Yonke, LispSupportMy understanding is that a {NODIRCORE} file goes away when it gets closed;TEdit character sources are subject to repeated opens and closes.If my understanding is wrong, I'll change at once--and a number of other spots,too!	--John*start*01275 00024 US Date: 29 Sep 83 16:43 PDTFrom: Yonke.paSubject: new LafiteTo: LispSupportcc: Yonke.paThere is a new Lafite with most of the bugs fixed and the following new items.NOTE:  As of this release LAFITEFLUSHMAILFLG is T (not NIL) so if you don't want Lafite to flush your mail from the Grapevine (or Maxc), you'd better set this to NIL.The line drawn thru messages to indicate they are deleted is now only one pixel high (if you prefer the old behavior or something slightly different set the var LAFITEDELETEDLINEHEIGHT to 2 or more).If the control key (CTRL) is down when you are extending message selection (RIGHT button) then even deleted messages are included in the extension.Message selection can now take place anywhere in the browser window.  To get the "window manipulation menu" you must RIGHT button in the title bar of the browser window.Bug report headers generated by Lafite for Lisp and Lafite now include the machine type and well as the system date.There is now a way to add your own "computable messsage forms" to the list of message forms -- i.e. you can cause a function to be called which should compute your own message template.

In the one example I just got "live", the trash is exactly 90 characters, and it happens to be the last 90 characters of a page.  It also so happens that the last 90 characters of a page in a standard Leaf ReadPage request lie on the second page of the etherpacket.  This strongly suggests a page-crossing bug in the BLT opcode (when Leaf blts the data from its etherpacket into the pmap buffer).  I considered the possibility of some kind of funny mapping bug that caused the ether controller to put trash into the second page of the packet, but then the checksum wouldn't check, so I think it unlikely.	Bill*start*00756 00024 US Date: 29 Sep 83 19:13 PDTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Forward loses only somewhatIn-reply-to: Sybalsky.PA's message of 29 Sept. 1983 11:27 am PDT (Thursday)To: Sybalsky.PAcc: vanMelle.PA, Yonke.PA, LispSupport.PAA {NODIRCORE} file goes away when its stream gets collected, not when the file gets closed.   If you hold on to the original stream, you ought to be able to reopen and get its contents.  However, our interface to OPENFILE, OPENSTREAM, etc. currently does not accept a stream as the NAME argument, and indeed, you run straight into the previously mentioned problems with PACKFILENAME/UNPACKFILENAME.After this release, I will make the attack on PACKFILENAME, OPENFILE, etc so that this all works.--Ron *start*01501 00024 US Date: 30 Sep 83 11:14 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite&Tedit: message display windowTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 27 Sep 83 14:24 PDTLisp-System-Date: 27-SEP-83 19:52:39Is there any easy way for me to hardcopy a message in a different font than default?  I think it used to be the case that I could change the Looks of the text in the display window and then use Tedit hardcopy (not a great method, but it didn't take much thought).  Nowadays, the display window appears to be readonly, which seems reasonable, put precludes this hack.  As far as I can tell, I have to remember what the magic Lafite variable is for hardcopy font.  Laurel has a feature, albeit with a terrible interface, that lets you set up various hardcopy "forms".  I used to use that mainly to give me three different fonts I could print messages in (normal, small, fixed-pitch).Meanwhile, I noted that when I bugged left in the message display window, I got the tedit menu.  That seemed odd, but, okay, I just clicked outside the menu.  This invoked some furious swapping, which I interrupted to find it dwimifying the expression (replace EDITOPACTIVE of OLDVALUE with NIL).   Uggh!!  Two things: it's not nice to have system code require DWIMIFY in order to run, and whatever happened to my long-ago plea that the various tedit records NOT be copied into the compiled file, cluttering up the user's record space and slowing down the record package???	Bill*start*00805 00024 US Date: 30 Sep 83 15:23 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: state after GetMailTo: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 27 Sep 83 14:24 PDTLisp-System-Date: 27-SEP-83 19:52:39Is slightly weird.  The selected message is the first new one, but the state is not exactly the same as if I had selected that message in the normal context.  There are several ways this is true, not all of which I remember at the moment.  The one I noticed just now was that after GetMail, selector was at message n (say) and the currently displayed message was n-1.  Not being immediately interested in the new mail, I set the selector back to n-1, did an Answer, and then Display.  Normally this would move on to message n and display it, but instead it displayed message n-1 again.	Bill*start*00526 00024 US Date: 30 Sep 83 17:16 PDTFrom: withgott.paSubject: Lafite: Move/update/getTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, withgott.paLafite-System-Date: 29-SEP-83 15:17:12Lisp-System-Date: 30-SEP-83 16:37:09Machine-Type: DandelionI  just got a new installful.othello (5 p.m.) and find that the menu on the Active mail file is incomplete.Move To, Update, and Get Mail are missing.
