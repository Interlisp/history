Lafite is the Interlisp-D program that serves as your mail reading, composition and filing interface to the Distributed Message System.  Since you are reading this message, you have already learned to use the "Display" command.While reading a message in this window which has just opened you have the ability to scroll up and down as in TEdit, using the double-headed arrow cursor in the left margin. You may also notice that if you hold down the left or right mouse button in the scroll area, then continuous scrolling is performed.  If the words End of Message in italics are not visible, then there is more message to be seen, and you should scroll up to see more.When Lafite started up, it read in this mail file named Tutorial.mail.  An index of all messages in this mail file, called the Table of Contents, appears in the Lafite Browser window.  A triangular symbol at the left of the Table of Contents entry corresponding to this message indicates that it is the SELECTED message.  Invoking "Display" with the left mouse button displays the selected message into the  currently open Lafite browser window, or opens one if none is open.  Invoking "Display" with the middle mouse button displays the selected message into another Lafite browser window, which you will be prompted to open when the cursor changes shape.Another use of "Display" is very useful in reading through your mail sequentially.  If the selected message is the same as the message displayed in the message window (as it is now) then "Display" will automatically select the next message in the Table of Contents and display that message.  Notice that the Lafite message display window includes the message number and the complete filename for the Mail folder currently displayed.Further documentation on the Lafite Browser Window, the Status Window, and use of the commands and functions and variables can be found in the file Lafite.TED or Lafite.press.Try clicking the left mouse button over "Display" now.     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*01210 00024 USfDate: 23 Aug 84 14:23 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Displaying a selected messageTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasa     ----- Forwarded Messages -----Clicking the left mouse button while pointing at "Display" will continue to select and display the next message if you do not make any explicit selections in the Table of Contents.  You may explicitly select any message in the Table of Contents by moving the cursor into the line desired, noticing that the cursor has changed to a right-pointing arrow, and clicking the left mouse button.Try explicitly selecting some messages in the Table of Contents now, but do not invoke "Display" on any of them just yet.The Table of Contents may also be scrolled up or down as in TEdit or continuously.  Scroll the Table of Contents now so that message number 1 is visible, and select that message.If you invoke "Display" now, you will display the selected message as it is not the currently displayed message.  Invoke "Display" to see how displaying an explicitly selected message works, then invoke "Display" twice more to cycle through these messages until you are reading message number 3.     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*01935 00024 USfDate: 23 Aug 84 14:29 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Message number 3 in Tutorial.mailTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasa A question mark next to an entry in the Table of Contents indicates that the corresponding message has not yet been seen.  You may have already noticed that "Display" automatically removes a question mark from the Table of Contents entry if one was present.These question marks are a case of message marks.  You may change any mark in the Table of Contents by pointing at the mark with the cursor, clicking the left mouse button, and then typing a single character.  You may even change a mark back to ? to restore its unseen status.  The best way to erase a mark is to change it to a blank.   Some Lafite commands change the mark automatically.  For example, if you select the Hardcopy command, Lafite will put an "h" next to the message hardcopied.  You may play around with the marks now, but please leave the question marks on messages 4 through the end.When Laurel reads a mail file, it automatically selects and positions the Table of Contents at the first question marked entry.  This allows you to keep your place easily in your mail file between sessions of using Lafite.Command invocation in Lafite is accomplished by pointing the cursor at a command, pressing down on the left button, and releasing the button while still pointing at that command.  If you move away from a command while the button is still down, then that command will not be invoked when you release the button.  It is best to point at commands from below (the "hot spot" is at the tip of the cursor arrow; placing the cursor on top of a command may not activate that command.Try moving the cursor around the screen with the left button depressed (release the button over a neutral area such as over this message text.)Invoke "Display" for the next message.     ----- End of Forwarded Messages -----*start*01374 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 11:46 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: "Delete" and "Undelete"To: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasa"Delete" is used to delete the currently selected message.  Invoke "Delete" now and observe its effect.This message has now been marked for deletion.  When you "Quit", or when you read a mail file, all messages marked for deletion are really deleted--there will be no way to restore them to your files.  Be careful about the messages you delete. Lafite has another technique to deal with mail you don't want in your current mail file, namely the "Move to" command.  "Move to" will be explained in a later message.If a message has been marked for deletion, it may be restored to good health by selecting that message in the Table of Contents and invoking "Undelete".  Try "Undelete" now.Selecting a Table of Contents entry with the right mouse button extends the selected message to a range of selected messages.  Selecting a Table of Contents entry with the middle mouse button adds that message to the message already selected; selecting a Table of Contents entry with the middle mouse button while holding the SHIFT key down removes that one message from the set of messages already selected.  Try selecting a variety of messages and "Delete" and "Undelete" them.Select message 5 with the left mouse button and invoke "Display".*start*00402 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 11:51 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Reshaping Message Display WindowsTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaReading some of the previous messages may have been a bit uncomfortable due to the size  or location of the displayed message window.

The Lafite Mail Browser window (Table of Contents) and the Message Display window are scrollable, as the the Message Editor window.  The cursor shape will change to a shaded triangle when the middle button is down in the scrolling region of the window.  If you lift up on the middle button while still in the scrolling region, the text will repaint itself according to the relative position of the cursor along the length of the thumb line.  The top of the scroll bar corresponds to the beginning of the text and the bottom of the scroll bar corresponds to the end of the text.Try thumbing this message to various places.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*02703 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 13:59 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: "Move to" and "Browse"To: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaThe mail file you are now reading is named Tutorial.mail.  The default mail file that Lafite uses when you do not specify a particular mail file is named Active.mail.  More on this in the message on the Lafite Status Window.Lafite allows you to arrange your messages in separate batches called mail files. If you wish to move a message from the mail file you are now reading to another mail file, "Move to" will accomplish this.  When you invoke "Move to" with the left mouse button, a menu of known mail folders pops up, as well as the option **Other Folder**.   A new mail folder, or an existing mail folder which is as yet unknown to your Lafite.Profile can be added by selecting **Other Folder** and typing in the name of the folder in the prompt window of the browser window.  You will then be asked to confirm the move.  When the move is successful, the messages are marked deleted in the source browser window, and given the "m" mark.  Again, you may select multiple messages with the middle mouse button, or a sequential (extended) group of messages with the left and right mouse buttons.  After the move is complete, the message "--Default 'Move To': {host}<dir>foldername.mail" will appear in the source browser window.  Hereafter, selecting a message and mousing "Move To" with the middle mouse button will move it to the default folder.Make sure that this message is the selected message, and move it to a file named Test.  Confirm that you want this new mail file when the prompt appears in the browser window.Invoke "Undelete" to keep a copy of this message in the Tutorial.mail file.Set the mark on this message (message 7 in the Table of Contents) to ?.Now we will read the Test.mail file (it should have only one message--this one--in it).  Invoke "Browse" in the Lafite Status Window and select **Other Folder** so that you may type in Test.  You will be prompted to specify a region for the Test.Mail browser window.  Do this, and then invoke "Display" when ready to read this message (from this point on) in that file.Here we are in Test.mail.  Delete this message. Use the right mouse button to Close the Test.mail window.  A menu will pop up asking if you would like to "Write out Changes Only", "Expunge Deleted Messages", or "Don't Update File".  Select "Don't Update File" for now.  In the future, you will want to "Expunge Deleted Messages", and Lafite will update the Table of Contents and write out a back-up version with the extension ".mail-Lafite-TOC".  Now go back in Tutorial.mail and invoke "Display" on the next message.*start*01586 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 14:08 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: "New mail" and "Get Mail"To: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaNew mail that has been sent to you is collected in your inbox on another computer.  The "New mail" message in the Lafite Status Window is used to tell you that mail has arrived.  The following is an explanation of how to use "Get mail", but do not invoke it during this tutorial session because the mail will be delivered to the Tutorial.mail folder.  Also, if you are not registered yet,  you will retrieve mail belonging to the person  named (New Mail for Name.Registry) in the Lafite Status Window.  WARNING: It is very easy to bring mail to Lafite, but it is tedious to move mail back to your inbox.  The ordinary way to deal with new mail is as follows:1. Make sure that your current mail file is Active.mail.  You may have to invoke "Browse" to achieve this.  (Do not do this now.)2. Invoke "Get Mail".  (Do not do this now.)  This may take some time, but it will append all your new mail to the end of the current mail file.3. You may read this new mail, delete some of it, move some of it to other mail files, or leave some mesages in Active.mail as a reminder to you that you have not fully acted upon them."Get mail" will fail if you are not properly logged in.  To log in type (LOGIN) at the top level of Lisp.Every five minutes, Lafite checks your inbox to see if it contains any new mail.  When Lafite discovers that you have new mail it will tell you in the Lafite Status Window.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01427 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 14:33 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: "Hardcopy"To: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaLafite provides a hardcopy function that prints selected messages as formatted memos, with each message starting a new page.  Lafite uses the information in the file Lafite.Profile on your disk for various parameters affecting hardcopy.  The information in Lafite.Profile is read by Lafite once at the start of each session.  Therefore, if you modify Lafite.Profile, and you wish to have Lafite notice the change, you must "Quit" from Lafite and restart (by typing Lafite at the top level of Lisp.)Invoke "Hardcopy" with the left button now.  Notice that the  Interlisp-D prompt window says "Formatting for print" tells you that the print server is "Spooling and waiting" and that it's "done".  You may select several messages to be hardcopied together.  Deleted messages will not be hardcopied.  If the amount of output will be very large, Lafite will break up the transmission of your hardcopy into batches.  This is done to be kind to your print server and to other users of that server who will be able to print output between your batches of mail.  Note:  Lafite considers the hardcopy to be printed as soon as it has been accepted by the printing server.  There may be some additional delay at the printer before your hardcopy is actually printed.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*02910 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 15:08 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: "Send Mail" "Answer" "Forward" -- Composing messagesTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaComposing messages that you wish to send is very easy in Lafite.  Invoking "Send Mail" from the Lafite Status Window opens up a TEdit window.  At the top of the text editor window is a horizontal menu for telling Lafite what to do with the message being created.  When your message is composed, you can Deliver, Save Form, or Abort.  More on these later.The Lafite editor is like TEdit.   One may use Shifted Selection to move text from the Message Display window, or from another TEdit window which may have desired text in it.  Buttoning MIDDLE in the black title bar brings up the TEdit pop-up menu (Put, Get, Include, Find, Looks, Substitute,  Quit, Hardcopy, Press File and Expanded Menu).To start composing a message, fill in the form fields which are enclosed in ">>" and "<<"., e.g. , >>Recipients<<, >>Subject<<.If you want to answer a message you have selected and Displayed from your browser window, selecting "Answer" automatically fills in the To: field with the name(s) of the sender(s) of the currently selected message and fills in the Subject: and In-reply-to: fields. Try "Answer" to observe its effect.Likewise, "Forward" automatically copies the currently selected message(s) into the message body.  Try "Forward" now.Selecting "Get"  from the TEdit pop-up menu in the Message Editor prompts you for the name of a form previously saved as a file and replaces the current text in the Message Editor window with the contents of a file from your disk or from a file server.  This can be a message or form you composed earlier and then saved with the "Save Form" command from the Message Editor Window. Replacing, inserting or appending from a secondary selection works as in TEdit.  The secondary selection may be in either the message you are composing or the currently displayed message.  Shifted selection may be performed any time when type-in is acceptable (even into >>brackets!<<)  To make a shifted selection, hold down the SHIFT key, make your selection, then lift up the SHIFT key.  If you change your mind about the shifted selection, press DELETE before lifting up the SHIFT key.LAFITEDISPLAYFONT, LAFITEEDITORFONT and LAFITEHARDCOPYFONT are used for displaying messages, composing messages, and making hardcopy.  You may change them individually.  They should be FONTDESCRIPTORs as returned by FONTCREATE.  Initially they are all TimesRoman12.You may edit the parts of the message you are composing in any order. Try some editing by invoking "Send Mail", "Answer" and "Forward", but do not deliver it yet.  Select "Abort"to close the window and do nothing with the message.  Try "Save Form" if you have space on your disk or fileserver to save the message.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*02459 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 15:19 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Recipient namesTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaTo send a message, you must know the registered names of the intended recipients.  If you are properly logged in then your registered name will appear in the Lafite Status Window.  Anyone sending a  message to you will include your recipient name in the "To" or "cc" field of that message.If you have not yet logged in properly then you can do so with the (LOGIN) function and typing in your registered name followed by space bar, then typing in your password followed by carriage return.A registered name has two parts separated by a period.  The second part is a registry name, and the first part is the name for someone in that registry.  A registry is simply a group of related names, usually structured along organizational or geographical lines.  At present, the following registries exist:	DLOS - Dallas, TX 	ES - El Segundo, CA	FX - Fuji Xerox, Japan 	HENR - Henrietta, NY 	LB - Leesburg, VA 	PA - Palo Alto, CA	PASA - XSIS, AISBU, Pasadena, CA 	RX - Rank Xerox, England 	STHQ - Corporate Headquarters, Stamford, CT 	WBST - Webster, NY 	XRCC - Xerox Research Center, Toronto, CanadaMany messages are sent to recipients in the same registry as the sender.  Lafite allows you to omit the registry name for recipients who are in your DEFAULTREGISTRY, just as you may omit an area code when telephoning your neighbor across the street.  For example, someone in the registry for the Palo Alto area, say "Someone.PA", could send a message with the following acceptable message header:	Subject: Demonstration of recipient naming	To: Person1, Person2	cc: Person3, FarAwayPerson1.STHQLafite assumes that names that lack registries are in the sender's DEFAULTREGISTRY, which in this case is PA.  Since "FarAwayPerson1.STHQ" explicitly includes a registry,  STHQ rather than PA is used by Lafite.  Thus, in this case the message will go to Person1.PA, Person2.PA, Person3.PA, and FarAwayPerson1.STHQ.The DEFAULTREGISTRY is a variable you should be familar with, as it was set to something or NIL by your INIT file.  Type DEFAULTREGISTRY to the top level of Lisp to check the value of yours.If a recipient's registry is left out and is not the default, Lafite will redisplay the message and Lisp's Prompt Window will tell you which recipient's name needs a registry.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01344 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 15:42 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: "Deliver"To: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaInvoking "Deliver" will send the composed message to all the recipients named in the "To" and "cc" fields of the header. Each recipient will receive only one copy of the message, even if his or her name appears more than once."Deliver" confirms delivery with an icon shaped like an envelope.  Expanding this icon allows you to re-read the most recently delivered message, but it is grey-ed out as a reminder that it's already been sent.  Using the middle mouse button on the Expanded, delivered message allows to you select "New Edit Process".  If you do, the window will become activated again and you may send the same message to someone you forgot to include, or modify and message and resend it to everyone again.Try "Send Mail", fill in your own name in the To: field, be sure to delete the cc: line if you won't be using it, replace >>Subject<< field with the words "My first message", replace >>Message<< with an appropriately witty saying, and invoke "Deliver".  When the icon appears, the message has been deposited in your inbox.Later, when you invoke "Get mail" (wait until your current mail file Active.mail is open) you will see the message that you just sent.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01813 00024 USfDate: 27 Aug 84 15:46 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Public distribution listsTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaThe mail system provides a way to address messages to groups of recipients.  Each registry includes some recipient names whose first part ends with the character "^".  Such names identify groups rather than individuals.  Using such a name as the recipient of a message causes the message to go to all the individuals included in the group.  For example, the "To" line:     To: CSL^.PAwill cause the message to be delivered to all of the approximately 75 recipients in the Computer Science Laboratory of the Palo Alto Research Center.While you are able to send to any public distribution list in any registry, you should think very carefully about your choice of message and list so as not to bother recipients with messages they don't care to read.  Check with experienced users to find out which lists should be used for which kinds of messages.The public distribution lists for each registry are stored in a distributed data base system called Grapevine, which knows about all registered names and is also responsible for mail transport.  The membership of a list can be altered by that list's owners.  You can have your name added to a list by sending a message to the list's owners, who may be addressed as "Owners-X" where X is the name of the distribution list.  There are some lists to which you may add your own name without interacting with the list's owner.  Changing distribution lists is done by running the Maintain program, (LOAD 'MAINTAIN.DCOM).An index of all the public distribution lists in Grapevine is contained in the filed<Laurel>DLMap.txt, stored on the file server from which you obtained Lafite.  Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01871 00024 UShDate: 27 Aug 84 15:56 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Not implemented yetTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaLafite also provides a way for you to create private distribution lists.  A private distribution list is simply a file containing a list of registered names separated by commas, just as they would appear in the header of a message.  You can create such a file using the editor.Suppose you have such a private distribution list in a file on your machine's disk named, say, "MyFriends.dl".  To address a message to the members of this list, you may specify:     To: MyFriends.dl: ;in the header of the message (that is, the name of the file followed by a colon and then a semicolon).  Lafite will read the file as part of the "Deliver" operation and include all names found in the file as recipients for the message.You should understand that in general the recipients of such a message won't know who the other recipients were, since the contents of the distribution list are private.  If you wish to make the membership of the list visible, you may "expand" the list before delivering the message.  To do this, select the space between the colon and the semicolon, invoke the "G" keyboard command (COM-G in the modeless editor), fill in the "File" brackets with the name of the file (shifted selection is useful here), and strike ESC.  The result will be something like:     To: MyFriends.dl: Jones.PA, Smith.ES, Doe.WBST;It is also possible to use files stored on file servers as private distribution lists.  Remotely stored private distribution lists are useful if a group of people want to share the use of the list.  The syntax for naming such a list is:     "[server]<directory>filename.extension": ;Note that it is necessary to put double quotes around the entire file name.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01917 00024 USfDate: 28 Aug 84 09:37 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: "Get", "Put" and "Save Form" To: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaLafite provides several commands that read and write files on your local disk or on file servers.  These are the "Get" and "Put" commands available in the pop-up menu of the Message Editor.  All these commands require that a file name be specified.  The syntax for naming local files is "filename.extension"; for remote files it is "{server}<directory>filename.extension". Try the "Get" command now.  Invoke "Get" from the pop-up menu in the Message Editor window, then type the name of a text file into the brackets.  Terminate the file name with carriage return.  The message in the window has been replaced by your text file.  Do not edit it now.Now try the "Put" command.  Invoke "Put" from the pop-up menu.  Note that the caret is blinking in the prompt window after the default file name (same name as the original); you may type a new file name terminated by carriage return, or else just carriage return which will confirm the name already in the prompt window.  Strike carriagereturn now.  A new version of the file will be created.With "Get" and "Put", Lafite provides a simple text editor that may be used for numerous simple text editing tasks in conjunction with "Save Form".  Some typical uses of "Get" and "Put" or "Get" and "Save Form" are:1) Saving a composed message that couldn't be delivered due to network  problems.2) Creation of standard message forms or "boilerplate" for command files.  The  recommended method for creation of customized message forms is to start with a "Send Mail", edit it, and "Save Form" it on some easily remembered file.  The "Save Form" command will add .form to any file name not containing a period, so storing message forms on files with extension .form is recommended.Invoke "Display" to read the next message.*start*01306 00024 UShDate: 28 Aug 84 10:14 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: We're doneTo: Kiewietcc: Kiewiet.pasaMuch more information about Lafite is available in the file <Lisp>Library>Lafite.press  on your favorite file server.  We recommend that you read this manual soon to find out about many things that could not be included in this brief tutorial.Any comments you have about the operation of Lafite or about this tutorial should be sent to LafiteSupport.PA.  (There is a form you can "Get" when you invoke "Send Mail" from the BackgroundMenu.To leave Lafite, just select "Quit" from the Lafite Status Window.    Be sure that you have not deleted some precious message, as any deleted messages will be forgotten forever when the browser  window closes and its Table of Contents is updated.If you wish to move some of the previous messages to your Active file, you may do so now by selecting those messages and invoking "Move to" with Active for the file name in the brackets.  Messages 8, 10, and 12 are particularly relevant, as they contain information about actions that you were requested not to perform while you read through this tutorial.  Once you have moved these messages to Active, you may invoke "Browse" on Active and you will have become a real Lafite user.Good luck!
