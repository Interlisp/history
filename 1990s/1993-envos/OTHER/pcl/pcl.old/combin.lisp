Then the effective method functions we;;; generate are closures over the particular methods in the effective method;;; form.  This strategy has the advantage that we don't have to call the;;; compiler when we combine new methods.  It also has the advantage that;;; same shape effective methods share the same code vector.  It is of course;;; predicated on the same assumption PCL makes elsewhere that funcalling;;; compiled closures is fast.;;;;;; *effective-method-templates* is a list of effective-method template;;; entries.  Each entry is itself a list of the form:;;; ;;;   (<template> <match-function> <make-code-function>);;;;;; The match function is usually simple-effective-method-match-p, but is;;; sometimes complex-effective-method-match-p.  This depends on whether;;; or not we can use a simple code walker to match the template and the;;; form.  If we can, it means matching is faster.  We can so long as the;;; template contains no quoted constants, macros, or macrolet forms.;;; See the function forces-complex-walker-p for details.  This heuristic;;; seems to be right, but I don't have a proof for it.  A proof for it;;; would be nice though.;;;;;;(defvar *effective-method-templates* ())(defun show-effective-method-templates ()  (let ((times ()))    (flet ((record (x)	     (let* ((time (cadddr x))		    (entry (assq time times)))	       (if entry		   (push x (cdr entry))		   (push (list time x) times)))))      (dolist (template *effective-method-templates*) (record template))      (dolist (time times)	(format t		"~&~D entries compiled at time ~S."		(length (cdr time)) (car time)))      (dolist (time times)	(when (y-or-n-p "Show entries compiled at time ~S?
