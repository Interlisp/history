Here is the standard information about PCL.  I have also added you tothe CommonLoops@Xerox.com mailing list.Portable CommonLoops (PCL) started out as an implementation ofCommonLoops written entirely in CommonLisp.  It is in the process ofbeing converted to an implementation of CLOS.  Currently it implements aonly a subset of the CLOS specification.  Unfortunately, there is nodetailed description of the differences between PCL and the CLOSspecification, the source code is often the best documentation.  Currently, PCL runs in the following implementations of  Common Lisp:   EnvOS Medley   Symbolics (Release 7.2)   Lucid (3.0)   ExCL (Franz Allegro 3.0.1)   KCL (June 3, 1987)   AKCL (1.86, June 30, 1987)   Ibuki Common Lisp (01/01, October 15, 1987)   TI (Release 4.1)   Coral Common Lisp (Allegro 1.2)   Golden Common Lisp (3.1)   CMU   VAXLisp (2.0)   HP Common Lisp   Pyramid LispThere are several ways of obtaining a copy of PCL.*** Arpanet Access to PCL ***The primary way of getting PCL is by Arpanet FTP.The files are stored on arisia.xerox.com.  You can copy them usinganonymous FTP (username "anonymous", password "anonymous"). There areseveral directories which are of interest:/pclThis directory contains the PCL sources as well as some rudimentarydocumentation (including this file).In the directory /pcl the files:readme.text   READ ITnotes.text    contains notes about the current state of PCL, and some              instructions for installing PCL at your site.  You should              read this file whenever you get a new version of PCL.get-pcl.text  contains the latest draft of this message/pcl/docThis directory contains TeX source files for the most recent draft ofthe CLOS specification.  There are TeX source files for two documentscalled concep.tex and functi.tex.  These correspond to chapter 1 and 2of the CLOS specification./pcl/archiveThis directory contains the joint archives of two important mailingslists:  CommonLoops@Xerox.com    is the mailing list for all PCL users.  It carries announcements    of new releases of PCL, bug reports and fixes, and general advice    about how to use PCL and CLOS.  Common-Lisp-Object-System@Sail.Stanford.edu    is a small mailing list used by the designers of CLOS.The file cloops.text is always the newest of the archive files.The file cloops1.text is the oldest of the archive files.  Highernumbered versions are more recent versions of the files./pub/pcl.tar.ZThis is a compressed tar file contains above files other than archive messagesin /pcl/archive.*** Getting PCL on Macintosh floppies *** PCL is listed in APDAlog.  It is distributed on Macintosh floppies.This makes it possible for people who don't have FTP access to arisia(but who do have a Macintosh) to get PCL.For $40 you receive a version of PCL and a copy of the CLOS spec (X3J13document number 88-002R).  The APDAlog catalog number is T0259LL/A andyou can order by calling:  From the U.S.   (800)282-2732  From Canada     (800)637-0029  International   (408)562-3910  FAX             (408)562-3971NOTE:  Whenever there is a new release of PCL you want, you shouldprobably wait a couple of months before ordering it from APDAlog.  Wewant to let new PCL's stabilize a bit before sending it to them, and itwill take them some time to integrate the new disks into theirdistribution.*** Xerox Internet Access to PCL ***Xerox XNS users can get PCL from {NB:PARC:XEROX}<PCL>*** Getting a copy of PCL from ISI ***ISI distribute PCL with its Common Lisp distribution.  For furtherinformation about this send a message to ACTION@ISI.EDU.Send any comments, bug-reports or suggestions for improvements to:   CommonLoops.pa@Xerox.comSend mailing list requests or other administrative stuff to:  CommonLoops-Request@Xerox.comThanks for your interest in PCL.----------
