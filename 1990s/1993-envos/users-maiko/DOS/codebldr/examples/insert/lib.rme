                      Intel 386/486 C Code Builder(TM) Kit            Copyright 1991 Intel Corporation.  All Rights Reserved.                         Code Builder Example Programs        The examples programs in this directory originate from the        Companion Disk to the "Microsoft(reg.) C Run-Time Library        Reference" for Version 6.0 and are copyright 1990 by        Microsoft(reg.) Corporation.  A comment at the beginning of        each program gives the program name and a brief description of        its operation.        The following files are included:         LIB.RME      - Example programs information file.         MAKEFILE     - Example programs make file.         *.C          - C source modules for 241 example programs.        Of these 241 example programs, 227 port to the C Code Builder        environment without any changes.  Porting 4 of the remaining        programs required only minor changes regarding differences in        word size and memory models.  The remaining 10 programs        reference functions not supported by the C Code Builder Run-Time        Library (OS/2-specific and presentation-graphics functions and        the stackavail function).  The modifications are conditional on        the macro _INTELC32_ which is defined in the C Code Builder        environment.  Thus, the example programs remain compatible with        the Microsoft C Compiler as well.  Additionally, 6 of the        examples required changes due to errors in the orignal programs.        A summary of the files modified follows:                          Changes Required while Porting         Files Affected   to the C Code Buidler Enviroment        ---------------------------------------------------------------           putw.c         Required minor changes to accomodate a 32-bit           rot.c          word size rather than the 16-bit word size.           swab.c           bheapseg.c     Required minor changes due to differences in                          the implementation of based heaps.           bessel.c       Modified to correct errors or inconsistencies           dstime.c       in the original program.           fstat.c           heapmin.c           memmax.c           spawn.c           begthrd.c      Contain OS/2 or presentation-graphics           cwait.c        functions not supported by Code Builder.           pgachart.c           pgchart.c           pggpal.c           pipe.c           popen.c           signal.c           wait.c           alloca.c       References the stackavail function which is                          currently not supported by Code Builder.        A makefile has been provided to automatically build and execute        each of the examples programs, pausing for user input between        each step.  Change to the EXAMPLES\LIB directory and type        "make" to start this process.  Following the execution of each        step, the .obj and .exe files are deleted.  (Leaving the 241        .obj and .exe files would require a considerable amount of disk        space.) To override this feature type "make NO_ERASE=1".  A        single example can be built by typing "make example.exe", where        "example" is the name of the example program to build.
