                            Documentation Updates

                  ----------------------------------------
                       This file is called README.DOC
                  It has been installed to your hard drive
                  ----------------------------------------

     The following changes should be noted for your EZ-INSTALL documentation:


        1) NOTE TO CURRENT EZ-INSTALL USERS UPGRADING FROM VERSION 3.12
           (OR PRIOR)

        If you are using compressed files that were created with LHARC you
        need to recompress your files using the LHA compressor provided with
        this version.

        The compression utility provided with this version, LHA, uses
        a different and updated method.  Previous compression utilities, eg,
        EZARC or LHARC will not be compatible with this newest release of
        EZ-INSTALL.  LHA will provide better and faster compression and de-         compression during the installation.
        compression during the installation.


        2) Notes on use of SETUP Installation Aid Option
           (User's Guide, Volume 1, Chapter 13)

        If you use the automatic disk SETUP option, you cannot utilize the
        Ask Group feature described in the Installation Aid Handbook.

        Because SETUP updates your file lists, when you invoke SETUP and
        then UPDATE from the SETUP menu, any previous file lists you entered
        will no longer be available.  SETUP manages the file list input and
        description.

        When using the SPLIT option in SETUP, the reserved space necessary
        for your particular application cannot always be precisely determined.
        Although a default reserve space is provided, the amount actually
        needed can be affected by the size of your EZI.CFG file or your use
        of a PCXLOGO.PCX file with PCXVIEW.EXE.  Thus, you may find you need
        to adjust the reserve space from the default dependent on the
        particular EZ-INSTALL features you are using.  The screen displayed
        prior to performing the actual split of the files provides for an
        adjustment of the reserve value.


        3) FICLOSE Documentation (User's Guide, Volume , Chapter 12)

        The index entry for the FICLOSE statement is incorrect.  The following
        documentation belongs at the end of Chapter 12 (pages 12-9 and 12-10)
        regarding FICLOSE:

                 _______________________________________________________

                                     Library Closing
                 _______________________________________________________

                   Normally, you will load the executing installation
                   routine to memory when you execute the EZ-INSTALL
                   runtime command (INSTALL.EXE.)  In addition, you
                   should load to memory at the beginning of your
                   routine all forms and menus you will be working with
                   (once they are loaded to memory they can be displayed
                   with the DEFLOAD function whenever you need them.)
                   This allows disks to be pulled and swapped while
                   still providing EZ-INSTALL all files that are
                   required.

                   FICLOSE provides a means for "shutting down" the .OLB
                   library file that contains your executing
                   installation routine so that the operating system
                   does not continue to try to reference it.  This is
                   important if you have a multiple disk installation.

                   Once all forms and menus in your routine are loaded,
                   the FICLOSE command should be issued to "shut down"
                   the library.  Simply issue FICLOSE with a null
                   filename (two single quotes):

                      FICLOSE('')

                   This command can be placed anywhere in your
                   installation routine but should be placed before
                   there is a possibility of the first installation
                   diskette being pulled by the user (i.e., before you
                   ask them to "Insert Disk # 2.....".)

                   This use of FICLOSE prevents the operating system
                   from needlessly trying to further reference the
                   library after the floppy disk containing the library
                   has been pulled.

                   See the EZ-PAINT User's Guide, Chapter 8, for further
                   information on loading and displaying menus and forms
                   with DEFLOAD and DEFDISP.  See Chapter 11 in this
                   manual for further information on the EZ-INSTALL
                   runtime command.


        4) SWAP_ (User's Guide, Volume 2, page C-13)

        The last line on page C-13, describing SWAP_, should read:

        "....EZ-INSTALL will swap itself out of memory to the drive
        indicated by..."
