Scalebitmap

This package scales bitmaps.  The bitmaps can be made either larger or smaller.  The algorithm does not do any smoothing or averaging.

(SCALEBITMAP BITMAP FACTOR)

Scales the bitmap BITMAP by FACTOR.  FACTOR can be any of the following: an integer representing the percentage amount, e.g., FACTOR=67 means reduce the x and y dimensions to 67% of their orginal; a floating point number, e.g. FACTOR=1.3 means increase the x and y dimensions by a factor of 1.3; a dotted pair whose CAR is the factor for the X dimension and whose CDR is the factor for the Y dimension, e.g. FACTOR=(2.3 . 81) means increase the X dimension 2.3 times and decrease the Y dimension to 81%.
