For example:#||(defsystem my-very-own-system	   "/usr/myname/lisp/"  ((classes   (precom)           ()                ())   (methods   (precom classes)   (classes)         ())   (precom    ()                 (classes methods) (classes methods))))This defsystem should be read as follows:* Define a system named MY-VERY-OWN-SYSTEM, the sources and binaries  should be in the directory "/usr/me/lisp/".  There are three files  in the system, there are named classes, methods and precom.  (The  extension the filenames have depends on the lisp you are running in.)  * For the first file, classes, the (precom) in the line means that  the file precom should be loaded before this file is loaded.  The  first () means that no other files need to be loaded before this  file is compiled.  The second () means that changes in other files  don't force this file to be recompiled.* For the second file, methods, the (precom classes) means that both  of the files precom and classes must be loaded before this file  can be loaded.  The (classes) means that the file classes must be  loaded before this file can be compiled.  The () means that changes  in other files don't force this file to be recompiled.* For the third file, precom, the first () means that no other files  need to be loaded before this file is loaded.  The first use of  (classes methods)  means that both classes and methods must be  loaded before this file can be compiled.  The second use of (classes  methods) mean that whenever either classes or methods changes precom  must be recompiled.Then you can compile your system with: (operate-on-system 'my-very-own-system :compile)and load your system with: (operate-on-system 'my-very-own-system :load)||#;;; (defvar *system-directory*);;;;;; *port* is a list of symbols (in the PCL package) which represent the;;; Common Lisp in which we are now running.
