How to TEX the CLOS SpecificationThere are 2 source files, 2 table of contents files, and 3 macro/fontfiles that you need to TEX the CLOS specification (I use upper case forfilenames and TEX):	CONCEP.TEX	;source file	FUNCTI.TEX	;source file        CONCEP.TC       ;table of contents        FUNCTI.TC       ;table of contents	MACROS.TEX	;macros file	AMFONT.TEX	;macro/fonts	CMFONT.TEX	;macro/fontsThese files are on arisia.xerox.com, in the /pcl/doc directory.  You canuse anonymous FTP to retrieve them.  Login with username "anonymous" andpassword "anonymous".You will need only one of the two fonts files, but that depends on thestatus of the TEX at your site. Your best bet for determining which to useis to take them both and try TEXing one of the source files and seeingwhether it works.In MACROS.TEX there are two lines:\input cmfont%\input amfontIf your site supports the up-to-date Computer Modern family of fonts,this configuration of these two lines will work. Otherwise, your site supportsthe older Almost Modern family, and you should edit MACROS.TEX so that thosetwo lines look like this:%\input cmfont\input amfont``%'' is the comment character in TEX.There is one other adjustment you might have to do. Suppose that you TEXa file and your printer places some of it off of the page, but otherwiseit looks good. There are two lines in MACROS.TEX that help with this,but they are commented out:	%\hoffset 1.0in	%\voffset 1.0in  These are commented out because TEX on SAIL does not need non-zerooffsets to work, while at Lucid we do need such an offset. You willsimply have to look at the output to decide.There might be a fair number of underfull and overfull box warnings, whichyou can ignore.     rpg
