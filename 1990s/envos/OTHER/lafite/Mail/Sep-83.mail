The file with the correct version number was in fact open, as testified by OPENP.I presume that Lafite is not passing around the full name of the file, and that this is running up against the INFILEP bug in Leaf.

On returning from Logout, I was warned in the TTY window that the file had  changed.  I was warned again in the prompt window that it had changed, with the additional comment that it was going to be reparsed, and then reparsing began.Several glitches:1.  Why use both the prompt window and the TTY window?  I'd say put the warning just in the TTY window, where the user is focussed waiting for the logout to return.2.  Why "reparse"?  In this case, the mail file had changed, but I had done asuccessful and complete update in the other system, so presumably the table-of-contents file in the directory was valid.  Can't the TOC be verified and then used?3.  The reparsing actually happened in the TTY process, thereby tying up my machine for half an hour or so.   Can't the reparsing be done in a separate process, just  as browsing is done?4.  While it was reparsing, the old browse window was on the screen, even though it was invalid.

After all,Fillet works very well (the only important thing it lacks at the momentis the ability to send ARPAnet and Usenet mail -- all else is merepecadilloe.)  Obligatory curtseys discharged, here goes:1.  I agree that the mail files: subView is not very helpful.  Themessage you are looking at may be in other files that haven't beennoticed yet.  If so, the mail files: subView has bad information in it.2.  I wish Fillet didn't use a clock face to tell the time a message wassent.  Two reasons for this: I am used to digital time for comparing theoccurances of past events, and have a hard time using analog clock facesto deal with anything but the current time of day.  Since starting to useFillet, I have tended to ignore time information in message headers becauseI find it hard to read.  The second problem I find with the clock is that bythe time I edit the subView boundaries to get a message header subViewthat is tall enough to suit me, the clock face often overflows onto thedisplay background.3.  I find that unless I edit the subView boundaries in the MailReader, theheader information often overflows its subView.  For some reason, having toscroll to see all of the header info seems particularly annoying.4.  I think you should make the filter subView somewhat (15 -20 percent)narrower, making the Table of Contents subView (or whatever it's called --the one in the upper right corner) wider.  There are some messages (installmentson AIList, for example) in which the critical difference between any two install-ments is a version number at the very end of the string.Long Live Fillet.

How should the release message handle this?  My inclination would be to include in the release messsage a brief (2-3 paragraph) description of these packages, and include a pointer to their full documentation on Phylum.Which leads to two questions of John and Marty:  Is the documentation on Phylum up to date?  If not, could it be made so by  Fri. night?  -- Tayloe.*start*01275 00024 US Date: 29 Sep 83 16:43 PDTFrom: Yonke.paSubject: new LafiteTo: LispSupportcc: Yonke.paThere is a new Lafite with most of the bugs fixed and the following new items.NOTE:  As of this release LAFITEFLUSHMAILFLG is T (not NIL) so if you don't want Lafite to flush your mail from the Grapevine (or Maxc), you'd better set this to NIL.The line drawn thru messages to indicate they are deleted is now only one pixel high (if you prefer the old behavior or something slightly different set the var LAFITEDELETEDLINEHEIGHT to 2 or more).If the control key (CTRL) is down when you are extending message selection (RIGHT button) then even deleted messages are included in the extension.Message selection can now take place anywhere in the browser window.  To get the "window manipulation menu" you must RIGHT button in the title bar of the browser window.Bug report headers generated by Lafite for Lisp and Lafite now include the machine type and well as the system date.There is now a way to add your own "computable messsage forms" to the list of message forms -- i.e. you can cause a function to be called which should compute your own message template.

In the one example I just got "live", the trash is exactly 90 characters, and it happens to be the last 90 characters of a page.  It also so happens that the last 90 characters of a page in a standard Leaf ReadPage request lie on the second page of the etherpacket.  This strongly suggests a page-crossing bug in the BLT opcode (when Leaf blts the data from its etherpacket into the pmap buffer).  I considered the possibility of some kind of funny mapping bug that caused the ether controller to put trash into the second page of the packet, but then the checksum wouldn't check, so I think it unlikely.	Bill*start*00756 00024 US Date: 29 Sep 83 19:13 PDTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Forward loses only somewhatIn-reply-to: Sybalsky.PA's message of 29 Sept. 1983 11:27 am PDT (Thursday)To: Sybalsky.PAcc: vanMelle.PA, Yonke.PA, LispSupport.PAA {NODIRCORE} file goes away when its stream gets collected, not when the file gets closed.   If you hold on to the original stream, you ought to be able to reopen and get its contents.  However, our interface to OPENFILE, OPENSTREAM, etc. currently does not accept a stream as the NAME argument, and indeed, you run straight into the previously mentioned problems with PACKFILENAME/UNPACKFILENAME.After this release, I will make the attack on PACKFILENAME, OPENFILE, etc so that this all works.--Ron *start*01501 00024 US Date: 30 Sep 83 11:14 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite&Tedit: message display windowTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 27 Sep 83 14:24 PDTLisp-System-Date: 27-SEP-83 19:52:39Is there any easy way for me to hardcopy a message in a different font than default?  I think it used to be the case that I could change the Looks of the text in the display window and then use Tedit hardcopy (not a great method, but it didn't take much thought).  Nowadays, the display window appears to be readonly, which seems reasonable, put precludes this hack.  As far as I can tell, I have to remember what the magic Lafite variable is for hardcopy font.  Laurel has a feature, albeit with a terrible interface, that lets you set up various hardcopy "forms".  I used to use that mainly to give me three different fonts I could print messages in (normal, small, fixed-pitch).Meanwhile, I noted that when I bugged left in the message display window, I got the tedit menu.  That seemed odd, but, okay, I just clicked outside the menu.  This invoked some furious swapping, which I interrupted to find it dwimifying the expression (replace EDITOPACTIVE of OLDVALUE with NIL).   Uggh!!  Two things: it's not nice to have system code require DWIMIFY in order to run, and whatever happened to my long-ago plea that the various tedit records NOT be copied into the compiled file, cluttering up the user's record space and slowing down the record package???	Bill*start*00805 00024 US Date: 30 Sep 83 15:23 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: state after GetMailTo: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 27 Sep 83 14:24 PDTLisp-System-Date: 27-SEP-83 19:52:39Is slightly weird.  The selected message is the first new one, but the state is not exactly the same as if I had selected that message in the normal context.  There are several ways this is true, not all of which I remember at the moment.  The one I noticed just now was that after GetMail, selector was at message n (say) and the currently displayed message was n-1.  Not being immediately interested in the new mail, I set the selector back to n-1, did an Answer, and then Display.  Normally this would move on to message n and display it, but instead it displayed message n-1 again.	Bill*start*00526 00024 US Date: 30 Sep 83 17:16 PDTFrom: withgott.paSubject: Lafite: Move/update/getTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, withgott.paLafite-System-Date: 29-SEP-83 15:17:12Lisp-System-Date: 30-SEP-83 16:37:09Machine-Type: DandelionI  just got a new installful.othello (5 p.m.) and find that the menu on the Active mail file is incomplete.Move To, Update, and Get Mail are missing.

Is it really intended that this should remain after the messages have actually been transfered?  If so, would it not be better if it said something like "Last moved to ..."?(2)  Lafite mail folder browser windows look awful in a proportional font, because the columns all get unaligned.  Is it worth using tabs in some way to get around this?  (I got around the problem in the BIG package by specially supplying these windows with a series of fixed-width fonts.)(3)  Retreiving large amounts of mail takes for bloody ever.  20 minutes ago I said get mail, and Lafite informed me that it was retreiving 308 messages (I just got back from Washington).  No sign of anything's being done yet.  It would be sort of nice to know how far things had gotten.  A graphical display of some sort would be super -- for example a bar that grew as more mail was retreived.-- Tayloe.*start*00187 00024 USaDate:  4 Sep 83 17:41 PDTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: LAFITE DOCUMENTATIONTo: yonkeMarty:Where is the TEdit readable version (or bravo) of the Lafite doc?Beau*start*00413 00024 US Date: 6 Sept. 1983 12:31 pm PDT (Tuesday)From: Sybalsky.PASubject: Re: Lafite: CLOSEALL during get mailIn-reply-to: Burton's message of 6 Sep 83 12:26 PDTTo: Burtoncc: Yonke, LispSupportAll TEdit does is open the output file and shovel bytes out to it.

It is part of the V35 Smalltalk-80 System.Some somewhat obsolete design documentation is stored on:		[Filene]<St-Louis>Fillet-UserModel.press		[Filene]<St-Louis>Fillet-Interface.pressA user tutorial (currently being edited) is stored on:		[Filene]<St-Louis>FilletTutorial.mail	(and .press)		[Filene]<St-Louis>FilletMenus.mail	(and .press)Fillet's interface uses Filters rather than mail files for classifying mail, but until a proper database is available to Smalltalk, Fillet uses Laurel format mail files for storing mail, with some wrinkles:	1.  Fillet stores some Grapevine items in the mail file stamps, starting at character 24.		To be recognized by Fillet, the first item must be a Postmark (10B).		The only other item currently used is Emphasis Runs (1040B).	2.  Fillet normally deletes letters from mail files by changing the "deleted" character in the stamp.	3.  Fillet ignores the Laurel TOC file, and deletes it (if present) after updating a mail file.One side effect of the non-standard stamp is that the Laurel MailFileScavenger does not work properly on Fillet mail files.Fillet does not have a proper ARPAnet address parser yet.  This, and many other changes, are on the way.If you notice any problems with messages sent by Fillet, please let us know.	-- Steve & Dave*start*00245 00024 US Date: 17 Sep 83 16:12 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: newer MAINTAINTo: LispSupportThe GRAPEVINE that goes with this one does require a new Lafite, since some names were changed.

However, I plan to do this soon.  In looking at the current code there are two possible interfaces for sending messages you created yourself.  One takes a text stream as the message, parses it to find the recipients and sends the message.  The other takes a text stream and a list of recipients, doesn't parse the message but sends it to the list of recipients -- useful if you aren't following the header conventions in the message body.  Neither of these have been "ruggedized" for external use and I would like to do that before "releasing" them.  This is simple.Its a bit trickier for giving you a handle onto incoming messages and not degrade the performance for everyone else who is not using this feature at the same time.  My current inclination is to have another definition of RETRIEVEMESSAGES that you can load on top of standard Lafite.  Then for each message recieved I would parse the header and call a user function with a stream and a list in property list format of all the fields in the header with their values being objects of the right type (e.g. strings for Subject:, but a list of addresses for To:).  The value returned from the user function would say whether to put the message in the default mail folder or that the function took care of the message (of course I also have to create an interface to allow you to put the message in a arbitrary folder the "correct" way).  Suggestions are welcome concerning the handling of income messages since this has not been written yet.This should all happen in a week or two.Martin*start*00564 00024 US Date: Fri, 23 Sep 83 12:27:42 PDTFrom: FilletSupport.paSubject: New FilletUsers DLTo: FilletUsers^.pacc: Smalltalk80Users^.pa, MessageSystemImplementors^.paSender: Putz.paReply-To: FilletSupport.paThere is now a FilletUsers^.pa distribution list.
