We've had quite a few problems down here, most of which I think are attributable to the fact that we're down here in Pasadena and have had a lot of problems with network connections lately.The first problem that comes to mind is an error that has cropped up twice now.  We get a break window with the message "Lafite is confused about the start of a message."  This happened with mail files on the file server and on the local disk.  We can close the Mail Browser, selecting the Don't Update option upon doing so, but when we try to re-Browse the file, we get the same break window before the Table of Contents displays.  The file seems to be almost a total loss (at least as far as reading the messages in the mail program; one can look at the file simply as rambling text).  Shouldn't one have some way saving the file, perhaps even selecting out my hand where the starts and stops of the messages are?Another recurring problem is a break window in the midst of retrieving one's  mail.  Most of the time this happens  when polling Semillon.ms from down here.  Usually the break window is called by SHOULDNT, the general "something has gone wrong but I don't know what" function.  This is fine for Interlisp-D hackers, but the general user (or even the Interlisp-D programmer who's not familiar yet with a lot of Interlisp-D) is completely lost.  A normal reaction for the user would be to bug "Get Mail" again, and again if necessary, thus stacking up the LAFITEGETMAIL processes into one big mess.  One also worries about losing the mail messages altogether (though the behavior seems to be that the mail box is not flushed until there has been a successful retrieval of all of the messages from that box, a good method).  Perhaps more feedback can be given to the user as to what went wrong (difficult), and how to get out of it and try again without dying (easier), and not to worry about losing the mail messages from the mailbox, they haven't been flushed.I realize that a lot of these bugs have not occurred up there, presumably because of more reliable networks and not as great a distance to some important things.  Would it be useful for someone from the Lafite Support Team to come down here to Pasadena to see it in action, and to perhaps see some of these bugs first hand (assuming of course that they do come up while down here)?  This way some bugs can be worked out that crop up in a different real-time environment than the one at PARC.I hope some of these ideas are of use.--Ken.*start*01248 00024 US Date:  4 Jun 84 14:33 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Pasadena ProblemsIn-reply-to: Feuerman.pasa's message of 4 Jun 84 09:50 PDTTo: Feuerman.pasacc: LafiteSupport.pa, Liles.pasaThe "Lafite is confused about the start of a message" seems to be correlated with breaks occurring during GetMail.  I've been trying to eliminate the places that can break during GetMail; the most important one was eliminated about a month ago.  I'd be interested in knowing where you got the SHOULDNT, since that especially should be eliminated.  Try getting a backtrace (BT!) from such places.Best recovery from "Lafite is confused..." is to delete the xxx.mail-lafite-toc file before rebrowsing the file.A special-case mail file scavenger is in the works (something much simpler than the full-blown Laurel scavenger, but which will handle the cases that seem to arise most often).I doubt it would be an effective use of the Lafite Support Team's time to come down to Pasadena, unless you should actually get a reproducible example that can't be diagnosed remotely.  Feel free to more thoroughly document the problems you do have, however, since that might provide enough clues for eliminating the major culprits.	Bill
