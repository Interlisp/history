If you set NLSETQGAG to NIL and try to parse the file, it will fall into a break, at which point call me and I'll come look.

The following is not conclusively funny (pasadena may have been doing something odd), but it seemed a striking coincidence.  Enclosed find what are now messages 189, 233 and 242.  Message 189 and 242 are nearly the same; both are in reply to message 233, which appears grossly out of chronological order (dated 29 Jul, it is among the Aug 1 messages).  However, there are no messages from Pasadena in between 189 and 233, so there may simply have been a gateway down at a critical moment.  The interesting coincidence is that one of message 189 or 242 is the one that was broken.  Looking at file pointers, I think it was 242, which starts at 204011, a more familiar-looking file pointer than 157189.  Further tidbit: I strongly suspect I deleted message 242, thinking it a duplicate.	Bill     ----- Fowarded Messages -----Date: Fri, 29 Jul 83 16:33 PDTFrom: raim.pasaSubject: Re: Problem Report P1157 (Sysout Fails)In-reply-to: "Kocher's message of Fri, 29 Jul 83 16:07 PDT"To: 1100Support.eoscc: LispSupport.pa, Kocher.pasaChris,We are in the process of finalizing a maintenance rlease of Fugue.

I just couldn't resist passing it on to somebody.Subject:	New Feature SuggestionDescription:I propose that there be two new classes of Hardy mail.  Registered and Certified mail.  Both classes of Hardy mail would be analogous to that of the US Postal systems.  Receipt of a piece of registered mail would send a return receipt to the sender of the message indicating that the recipient of the message did indeed receive (not necessarily read the message).  Many tiymes it is helpful to know that somebody got a message and also when they got it.  Certified mail would require that the recipient of the mail message re-specify their password before the message is actually placed in the in basket.  This would facilitate protection of possibly sensitive data from getting into the wrong hands at an unattended workstation.  Both options can be combined to produce registered/certified mail.I also propose that there be some mechanism in Hardy that allows distribution lists to be set up to include the notion of some automatic message archival system.  There are many instances that distribution list are set up and inevitably someone ends up keeping all of the messages and archiving them every now and then.  Many times, more than one person keeps a copy of a message that will probably never be needed but yet must be kept "just in case".  If there was optional automatic archival of messages sent to distribution lists, there would be no need to have 100 copies of some obscure message on MesaFolklore or Star Archetecture Interest on 100 different machines.*start*00725 00024 US Date: 15 Aug 83 16:03 PDTFrom: Burton.paSubject: lost messageTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Burton.paLafite-System-Date: 22 Jul 83 15:58 PDTI did a getmail which said that it got 1 message but most of the message was lost.

However, his requests were only for changes to one of the user interfaces into that system.I also think it is a bad idea to have an automatic notice when a message is retrieved by the recipient. There are some privacy issues here. If I had a private secretary screening my mail, I surely would fire him if he gave out information about what messages I read and when I read them. Why should I put up with that behaviour from my mail system. If a user really wants a notice to be sent when the target sees his message, then a request in that message would probably get the recipient to send an acknowledgement.The suggestion for re-authentication of the user before delivery of certain messages does very little to help security of sensitive material. If we really feel that unattended, logged-in work stations are a serious issue, then we have a lot of user-training (and a lot of work) to do.PK*start*00536 00024 US Date: 16 Aug 83 21:07 PDTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Lafite: NIL cc fieldTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 22 Jul 83 15:58 PDTThe following msg header generates a CC field of NIL when Answered.----------Date: Tue, 16 Aug 83 18:59 PDTFrom: Moran.pasaSubject: xxxxTo: 1100marketingsupport^.eoscc: Presson, Moran, (LouKaragianis, LarryKlein, BobMelville, RonRoberts, TedRoberts, MelYoung, JackGordon, BillHuber)PASAmail, Pahlavan, DonStewart, Grant, Marlett, SuggsReply-To: Moran.pasa*start*00657 00024 US Date: 16 Aug 83 21:30 PDTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Lafite feature requestTo: yonkeMarty:I am using Lafite heavily now (I'm sure you can tell) and generally liking it.

(Changing the generated date syntax seems simple also).(By the way, Interface.press does not specify who generates the postmark item.  A logical assumption was that the client should, just as it supplies the recipients, etc.  As such, I don't think allowing this would change the specification.)Another, perhaps safer, way to give the message a unique ID when sending is to change (or augment) the sending protocol to answer the new postmark.  The important issue is to associate the unique ID with the message right away.Given that Grapevine will not be changed, or even generalized, the solution we have chosen is to have a separate item type which contains a unique ID (in the form of a timestamp--just like a postmark item).  If a received message has this item, it is used as the unique ID, otherwise the postmark timestamp is used.-- Steve*start*00338 00024 USaDate: 23 Aug 83 12:01 PDTFrom: halvorsen.paSubject: >>Subject<<To: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, halvorsen.paLafite-System-Date: 22 Jul 83 15:58 PDTI am runnign with printermode set to interpress.

Besides fixing bugs, its main observable differences are:After sending a message, the sending window shrinks to a "cancelled envelope" icon with the # of recipients in the address field.You can now shrink  any browser window, and it will shrink to a "manilla folder" with the name of the message folder in it.There is now a 'SendMail' menu item in the background menu.  Even if Lafite is not running (i.e. there is now main Lafite status window), you can still send a message by buttoning this menu item (or explicitly calling the function SENDMAIL).  This gives you a "low overhead" method of sending messages without envoking all of Lafite.If you want messages sent by you to be automatically considered "seen" by Lafite for you, then set the variable LAFITEIFFROMMETHENSEENFLG to T (the current default).  Note:  you may want to change to value of LAFITEDISPLAYAFTERDELETEFLG to ALWAYS.If you want the to field in the browser window to be truncated in the browser window to what "fits" in the area rather than pushing the subject field further to the right, set the variable LAFITETRUNCATEFROMFIELDFLG to T (the current default).Retrieve mail status messages now appear in a window above the browser they are going into rather than the promptwindow.  This window is also used to asked about the file you want messages moved to using the 'Move To' command.As usual, suggestions and bug reports welcome.MartinP.S.

LAFITESENDINGFORMAT is only important for sending, not displaying fancy messages.I won't be in tomorrow, but if you need to get me, I'll be at home most of the day -- 328-6436.Good luck, and lets see some happy faces!!!!! Martin  ¬   TIMESROMAN           ¬ z·*start*01382 00024 US Date: 26 Aug 83 17:16 PDTFrom: Snyder.paSubject: Lafite: Misc.To: Yonke.pacc: Snyder.paLafite-System-Date: 24 Aug 83 11:41 PDTLisp-System-Date: 24-AUG-83 16:27:36I claim I lost about 30 messages by doing the following: (I have not tried to reproduce the behavior.)1) did getmail successfully, retrieving said 30 messages.2) read a few, deleted a few, left most unread.3) started another LISP from another terminal, and also started a LAFITE, bugging getmail.4) got some sort of error about active mail file being in some undesirable state, probably busy, open, or something.  if the complaint was that the file was already open, may have manually closed it.  don't remember if I backed out of the break or what.5) went back to previous job at other terminal, and exited LAFITE.6) returned to current job, and rebugged getmail.  retrieved mail did not contain the unseen messages from previous job.Comment on aborting from Save Form under Message Form: bugging abort should NOT!!! abort all the way out of Message Form, but only out of the Save Form query for a file name.  Once I carefully composed a message, bugged Save Form , and typed close paren, intending to Deliver the message instead of sending it, but ending up losing it.  (It wasn't under last message because of the way I tried to recover, I think.)Love those icons!Thanks.*start*00516 00024 US Date: 26 Aug 83 18:25 PDTFrom: Sybalsky.paFormat: TEditSubject: New Lafite on <Lispcore>sources>To: Yonkecc: Sybalsky.pa, BurtonMarty--	I fixed the Lafite code so it can now forward and hardcopy formatted messages.

My comment about a month was made in response to a question to me from Pete Fischer about the availability of Lafite to naive users.  My response (which I didn't save) was that it was being used here by Lispcore and would probably be ready of lisp users in a month and that an announcement of its availability would be made at that time.  One month is my personal impression based on the decreasing frequency of bug reports and increasing usage.  It was not a promise; I did not intend it to be a commitment and I still don't consider it to be one.  It was my best guess when asked by a friend how things were coming.  I too was surprised when Beau brought it up at the lisp meeting.  I can understand how it must seem like I had made a commitment and I'm sorry I didn't clarify with you after the meeting.I will definitely include you on any future discussions and will CC you on any messages I send that contain information about Lafite.  Richardps.

Even after you switch to a different current mail file, you may not be able to read, delete, or retrieve over that mail file until you deactivate Hardy.Furthermore, if you do this to four current mail files in succession without deactivating Hardy in between, you may soon crash with an uncaught SIGNAL MailFile.Error [unknown]./Ron*start*00496 00024 US Date:  7 Aug 83 17:22 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: more on SelectionTo: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 22 Jul 83 15:58 PDTIf I hold down left and move the mouse completely out of the browser window, Lafite is still tracking it, and when I let up, it selects some faraway message.  This is stupid.  If I move the mouse out of the window, Lafite should act as though I had never held left down at all, i.e. restore whatever the old selection was.	Bill*start*00682 00024 US Date: Tue, 9 Aug 83 17:21 PDTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Re: Date syntaxIn-reply-to: "Putz's message of Tue, 9 Aug 83 09:39 PDT"To: Putz, Robsoncc: LaurelSupport, MessageSystemImplementors^We know about the non-conforming dates in messages from Grapevine servers; but I can't say when the Grapevine implementors will have an opportunity to change this.  The Grapevine software has not been changed for a long time, perhaps as much as a year.  And there are old versions of Hardy and other programs that use hyphenated dates also.I think as a practical matter it would probably be easiest to accept the hyphenated dates, at least in the short term.	Ed*start*01387 00024 US Date: Wed, 10 Aug 83 17:49 PDTFrom: Putz.paSubject: Re: Date syntaxIn-reply-to: "Taft's message of Tue, 9 Aug 83 17:21 PDT"To: Taftcc: Putz, Robson, Birrell, LaurelSupport, MessageSystemImplementors^I agree that accepting additional date formats makes a mail system more robust, and I will probably knuckle under in this case.  However, if a standard is to be of any use, efforts should be made to conform to it.  I think it is reasonable to put some pressure on implementors of systems which do not conform.It has been almost a year since RFC-822 was published, and I get the impression that Grapevine will not be fixed until some other change needs to be made.  I'm a little surprised at the lack of interest in supporting the standard.-- SteveP.S.  I also find it interesting (and almost amusing) that Andrew Birrell, a Laurel implementor, is apparently still using Laurel 6, which also violates the RFC-822 date syntax...-------------------Date: 9 Aug. 1983 10:34 am PDT (Tuesday)From: Birrell.paSubject: Re: Date syntaxIn-reply-to: Putz's message of Tue, 9 Aug 83 09:39 PDTTo: Putz, RobsonYes, they violate the standard.
