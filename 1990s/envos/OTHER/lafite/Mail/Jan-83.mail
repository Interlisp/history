But I wouldappreciate it if you could continue to use Lafite and collect a list of flaws,suggestions, etc.Thanks,Martin *start*00470 00024 US Date: 11 Jan. 1983 10:04 am PST (Tuesday)From: burton.paSubject: I editted LAFITETo: yonkeinside GETMAILFILE to have it save the full file name in the mail file datastructure.

I have been using <XEOS> to set up a consistent set of releasable LISPUSERS packages, and was originally a bit too optimistic about what is releasable. Did somebody pick it up?*start*01398 00024 US Date: 12-JAN-83 12:52:53 PDTFrom: vanMelle.PASubject: LafiteTo: Yonkecc: vanMelle.PAMy Dandelion died, so I thought I'd try using Lafite...I called LAFITE(ON), and it nicely displayed my {DSK}ACTIVE.MAIL.  It told me I had new mail, so I bugged "new mail".  It said retrieving 2 messages from Semillon, but then put nothing into my Active.mail.My initial placement of windows was such that the Browser overlapped my tty window.  As a result, I had a hard time bugging menu items, because there is no way to bring the Browser to the top and keep it there.  This isn't really your bug; more like a standard window system aggravation.Sometimes Lafite fails to switch the right-facing arrow that comes up in the Browser margin back to the default cursor when the cursor moves out of the margin; sometimes even after the cursor is entirely out of the Browser window.I find in using Laurel and Hardy that it is nice that both of those systems display in a fixed area the news "You have new mail" or "Mailbox empty at <time>".  This makes it easy to tell at a glance whether there is new mail, and how recently it was checked for if there isn't.  Doing this in the promptwindow seems a loss.  If you put the main Lafite menu in a horizontal menu, it could perch nicely on top of your first Browser window, and have a well-defined space for this notification.	Bill*start*00376 00024 US Date: 12-JAN-83 12:55:34 PDTFrom: vanMelle.PASubject: More LafiteTo: Yonkecc: vanMelle.PAIn fact, it would be nice to have a status line or two for more than just the new mail status; all of the things that go to the Promptwindow now would be nicer put in a place associated with Lafite.  Stuff in the promptwindow is just too ephemeral.	Bill*start*00310 00024 US Date: 12 Jan. 1983 2:48 pm PST (Wednesday)From: vanMelle.PASubject: Re: LafiteIn-reply-to: Your message of 12-JAN-83 12:52:53 PDTTo: Yonkecc: vanMelleBack in Laurel now I see that Lafite DID retrieve my mail and put it inActive.mail; it just didn't update the Browser window.*start*00442 00024 US Date: 12 Jan. 1983 3:54 pm PST (Wednesday)From: raim.eosSubject: Re: LaFiteIn-reply-to: Masinter.PA's message of 12-Jan-83 11:13:25 PST (Wednesday)To: Masinter.PAcc: raim,  Martin, Yonke.PALarry,If it's on <XEOS>, you can be sure it's been picked up by the likes of Tom Lipkisor Darrel Van Buer.I will delete it from XEOS and await confirmation from Martin Yonke beforeofficially releasing it.-- Marty*start*01395 00024 US Date: 13 Jan. 1983 11:11 am PST (Thursday)From: Taft.PASubject: Arpanet mail statusTo: AllPA^.pa, AllES^.es, AllEOS^.eos, AllWbst^.wbst, AllHenr^.henr, AllDlos^.dlosReply-To: TaftOur connection to the Arpanet (using new protocols) remains somewhat flakey. Until further notice, you should not consider Arpanet mail to be a reliable formof communication.  We seem to have particular difficulty communicating withcertain specific hosts, including SU-SCORE and SUMEX-AIM.You should also be aware that a number of hosts have not (yet) converted to thenew protocols and therefore cannot be reached directly.  Some of these (e.g.,SU-AI = SAIL) can be reached indirectly by forwarding through relay hosts. Relay hosts which are believed to work include UTAH-20 and USC-ISIB.  Thereare two ways to address a recipient via a relay host:1)	recipient%recipient-host@relay-host2)	<@relay-host:recipient@recipient-host>Method 1 is not officially sanctioned by the protocols but is accepted by manymail servers.  Method 2 is the officially correct syntax; unfortunately, there is noway to send to such an address from Laurel or Hardy because it conflicts withthe syntax for expanding private distribution lists.There are still many rough edges in the Arpanet mail software, and very littlemanpower available to deal with them.  Please be patient.	Ed Taft*start*00214 00024 US Date: 13-Jan-83 17:45:59 PST (Thursday)From: vanMelle.PASubject: Lafite cleanupTo: Yonkecc: vanMelle.PAWhen Lafite quits, it should remove its stuff from AFTERLOGOUTFORMS, too.	Bill*start*00423 00024 US Date: 13-JAN-83 17:47:56 PDTFrom: SYBALSKY.PASubject: Lafite problemsTo: Yonke.pacc: SYBALSKY.PAMartin--	I'm in the midst of trying to start using Lafite.

From my reading of the code, it seems that it is chockfull of unchecked smash-the-world macros.  The multi-dimensionalfeature seems reasonable and desirable, but unless we are underuser pressure for an immediate higher performance in this area,I think the macros should be removed in favor of eventualmicrocode support.  I wouldn't want to maintain a system that madethese operations freely available to users.--Ron*start*00414 00024 US Date: 17-Jan-83 16:22:03 PST (Monday)From: vanMelle.PASubject: lafiteTo: Yonkecc: vanMelle.PAHave you considered reading Hardy files?  Laurel is willing to read them, except that it thinks there's a funny empty last message, and Hardy is willing to read Laurel files.

By no means is Lafite ready forrelease.  It's hardly started Alpha-testing locally.  Larry might havejust got carried away while updating {maxc}.By the way, is {maxc}<xeos> available to anyone who has D0 and is onthe ARPAnet?  Then Lafite won't do them much good for awhile.  It onlytalks to the Grapevine -- it might be good for someone in Webster butnot ISI.  There are plans to make Lafite run on Interlisp-Jericho andtherefore the interface to the "mail server" will have to be generalizedbut it's probably not a good idea to dangle something in the user's face and then tell him it's only good on the internal Xerox network.Talk to you soon after I've finished all my messages.Martin*start*00332 00024 US Date: 22 JAN 1983 2246-PSTFrom: HTHOMPSON.PASubject: GVUSER and MSUSERTo:   Yonkecc:   Masinter, SheilThere are version inconsistencies between my({IVY}<HTHOMPSON>LISP>RPC>) files and those on LISPUSERS.Please sort this out as best you can - RPC depends on the (my)new GVUSER.(See next message)ht*start*00703 00024 US Date: 22 JAN 1983 2255-PSTFrom: HTHOMPSON.PASubject: New Lispusers packagesTo:   Masintercc:   Sheil, Yonke, vanMelle, Jonl, Fikes, KayI have placed the following on [PHYLUM]<lispusers>:SIGNAL.DCOM,SIGNAL.PRESS,RPC.DCOM,LUPINE.DCOM.RPC will not (probably) run properly with the GVUSER which iscurrently on <lispusers>, which is why I am not making a general releasemessage now.

Namely, you had a "files loadcomp" command in a "declare: eval@compile" without a "donteval@load dontcopy".  Thiscaused the files BSP and PUP to be loaded "loadcomp" from<lispcore>sources> and since BSP was "loaded" it never loadedthe dcom file from <lispusers>.  Further changes to GVUSER shouldbe made from the sources in <lispusers> or please make the change in your version.Thanks,Martin
