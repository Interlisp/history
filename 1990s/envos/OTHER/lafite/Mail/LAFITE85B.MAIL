I'm looking through a 42,000 character message (no kidding, 42,000!), and am really only interested in finding a substring.  LafiteFind will tell me that the substring is in the message, and TEdit will find it for me if I'm in an edit window.  I'd like to find it straight from the message display window without having to bring up a TEdit window and shift-selecting it over.

And the next time I go to send a message, I get a window that is only what had been the top half.Is this a TEdit bug, or is it something that I need to know about?  My inclination would be to say that the CLOSEFN for a Tedit window should first unsplit it if necessary.I notice a similar glitch in that if I close a vanilla Tedit window while it is split, then the next time I call up TEdit I get only the top half window (although in this case the bottom half of the split window did get correctly closed).	Bill*start*00652 00024 USaDate: 13 Jun 85 10:58 PDTFrom: Sybalsky.paSubject: Re: TEdit: Lafite vs. Split windowsIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 3 Jun 85 18:03 PDTTo: vanMelle.pacc: TEditSupport.PAI've investigated this, and I think it's a fix you have to make:  When you close the message window, you have set the \WINDOW field of the textobj to NIL.  Alas, the unsplitting code depends on that being a list of the panes that the window has been split into.  Could you save that field somewhere, and restore it right before the close?  Then the fixes I just made will (a) close the sub pane, and (b) resize the window to its original shape.*start*00551 00024 US Date: 13 Jun 85 11:30 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: TEdit: Lafite vs. Split windowsIn-reply-to: Sybalsky.pa's message of 13 Jun 85 10:58 PDTTo: Sybalsky.pacc: vanMelle.pa, TEditSupport.PAI'm pretty sure I don't touch ANY fields of a textobj, including \WINDOW.

Do you detach any or all of the windows yourself in your closefn (like expanded menus, prompt window, etc)?Alternatively, you could define a tedit public interface that puts the window back together, say TEDIT.UNSPLIT.WINDOW, which is a noop if the window is in one piece.	Bill*start*00318 00024 US Date: 13 Jun 85 15:09 PDTFrom: Sybalsky.paSubject: Re: TEdit: Lafite vs. Split windowsIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 13 Jun 85 14:20 PDTTo: vanMelle.pacc: Sybalsky.pa, TEditSupport.PAI detach everything that I know about:  The prompt window, the expanded menus, and the subpanes.*start*00712 00024 US Sender: "Larry Masinter".PARCDate:  3 Jun 85 21:02:41 PDT (Monday)Subject: Lafite: After Deliver of split-window message, get spurious mouseconfirm, old window still thereFrom: "Larry Masinter".PARCTo: LafiteSupport.PAcc: TEditSupport.PALafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date:  2-Jun-85 17:44:12Machine: Dandelion (222#35#)Microcode version: 26,30Memory size: 15777Frequency: Once (probably ALways)Impact: ModerateI used the "split" interface to split a Lafite window (actually, accidentally).

This happens ONLY when this call is done with an expedited courier call; it seems to work fine for regular courier call.Inbasket.MailCheck still works fine with expedited courier call.  Inbasket.Logon as an expedited call worked fine in Services 8.0.  Anyone know what's going on?As a side note, does anyone know whether "Expedited Courier Call" has any official status outside its use in the Clearinghouse program?  The Mail protocol documents I have make reference to expedited call, but provide no mechanism like Clearinghouse's to decline the use of expedited call; i.e., there is no error corresponding to Clearinghouse's "CallError, problem = useCourier".  It is also unclear to which socket one should in general send expedited calls.	Bill*start*00917 00024 US Date:  5 Jun 85 20:23 PDTFrom: Fischer.paSubject: Re: QOD: Lafite Login stuck in an infinite loopIn-reply-to: Rhoades.pa's message of 5 Jun 85 19:46 PDTTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Jellinek.pa, Fischer.paThe MacIntosh always provides an ABORT button whenver it gets into a mode of some sort.

Unfortunately, I suppose that we did not make it clear to our clients when one should and should not use expedited courier? (we made this change believing that it would not impact any of our clients).  Currently, if you make an incorrect expedited call, you'll get back the error UndefinedError[0] (it will be named similar to the CLearinghouses error in our upcoming protocol changes).  Won't you be glad when we finally pin this all down and publish our protocol??If we need to, we can back out of this change (but it is not a light decision).  Is it important to you that we do so?  I'm trying to track down our other protocol clients to see if they have similar problems.Reason for policy decision:  the polling operations are done quite frequently and need to be fast and lightweight hence we expedite them.  Bulk data operations such as Post and Retrieve cannot be expedited so they're not.  All the other operations such as Logon, Delete etc bracket or are bracketed by normal Courier operations.  this means that a session has/will be established to the server and that there is little to be gained by making these calls expedited (unless you expect the logon to fail in which case you would save the overhead of establishing the session).We will make and implement this decision today.  Meantime, 8.1 is being brought up rapidly all over the country, if you anticipate this causing problems for other working groups (such as Pasadena?), you might want to warn them to hold off until whatever fix we decide on is available.I'm very sorry that I didn't consult you about this change at the time it was made, as I say, we did not realize the scope of expedited courier use.brenda*start*01655 00024 US Date:  6 Jun 85 13:10 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Services 8.1: Mail Server Error: (UNDEFINED.ERROR 0)In-reply-to: troisi.osbunorth's message of 6 Jun 85 12:32:08 PDT (Thursday)To: troisi.osbunorthcc: vanMelle.PA, Gealy.osbunorth, Read.osbunorth, LafiteSupport.PA, Masinter.PAI guess I'm a little surprised that the expedited machinery is written in such a way that it requires special effort for any particular procedure to use it.  But that's your business, not ours.  It happens that our call to Inbasket.Logon is often associated with little more than a MailCheck, and the expedited calls involved are certainly cheaper than starting up a full-fledged courier connection.  But the expense is not great enough to sweat about.  It's just a nuisance that the protocol had been defined without a UseCourier value for any of the error returns.

We are as interested as anyone in getting Services 8.1 installed everywhere.  The change to our code is minimal and has little external impact.  I will warn the lisp users around here that are using the affected software to load a new version of the mail software that doesn't attempt the no longer supported expedited calls.  This presumable will not affect customers, since none of them are getting 8.1, right?

If people really care about the ability to send formatted messages to Intermezzo users, there is some chance TEditSupport will provide an interface allowing Lafite to send the old style TEdit formatting.	Bill*start*01015 00024 US Sender: "Mark A.

I think you have a right to grumble a little about this though, because we did violate a couple of interesting principles:1. Protocol changes are not supposed to take people by surprise.2. It is somewhat odd to start raising the undefined error as an indication that only the Courier transport is supported for that call.I assume the responsibility for this, because I had enough information to have realized that this was going on. We should think about this protocol change in terms of whether it is the right thing to do, the right time, and the right technique, and not in terms of the 8.1 schedule.Mark*start*01008 00024 US

Full duplex ASCII terminals       must be supported.   User Interface      Basic functions should be prompt-driven.      Additional functions should be English command-driven, with menu command       selections optional.   Composing or Drafting Messages        Users should be prompted for required fields, such as:         To:                         Cc:         Subject:         Message:         Send?:                   Command mode should be available for designating optional fields, such       as:         Access Limited To:                    Acknowledgement of System Delivery Requested:         Acknowledgem…ot of User Receipt RequePed:         Action (specified):         Addendum To:         Author:         Blind Cc:         Comment:         Delivery Timing Specifications:            Rush:  (immediate)            Soon:  (hour or less)            Defer: (Overnight)            Start Delivery (at date/time):            Stop Delivery  (at date/time if not yet delivered):         Extend Access To:         File Copy:         From:         In reply To:         Keywords:         Part of:         References:         Reply To:         Route (in succession) To:         Pass (to next recipient):         Subcollections:         Submit To Library:      Editing Capabilities      Editing During Entry:         The following functions should be available during user text entry:            Backspace character, word, text, paragraph.              Retype line, paragraph            Current position indication            Continuous entry mode      Extended Editing Capabilities:            The following functions should be available for additional editing          operations:            Insert, Delete, Replace, Move, Copy, Transpose, Append, Break,             Sort, as appropriate, on entities such as:            Character, Word, Text, Visible Text Strings, Invisible Text             Strings, Paragraph, Groups of Paragraphs, Section, File, and             Message         Ideally, the text editor would facilitate the structuring of          information in hierarchical form, with commands provided for the          viewing of selected portions of messages (long messages may be          considered to be documents) according to their structure.   Accepting Prepared Input From Stand-alone Terminals       Users must be able to easily transfer pre-typed, formatted text from       stand-alone terminals to the message system.   Message Files      One primary file should be designated for receipt of messages.  In       addition, other user-designated files should be available for placement       of messages as part of the users' message management operations.   Message Formats      Message formats must be consistent with required MILNET message format       protocols.  This includes, at a minimum, adherence to MILNET-specified       required fields and addressing protocols.   Message Identifiers      Message identifiers must be unique for each message.  Within the       identifier scheme, the number of such identifiers must be expandable to       at least 1 million unique messages.   Message Headers      Message headers should contain at least the unique message identifier,       the date the message was transmitted by the sender, and the text of the       subject of the message.   Message Fields -- Required and Optional      Required message fields should be kept to a minimum to facilitate use for      simple transmissions and use by relatively un-trained users.  In       addition, there should be a wide range of optional fields available to       facilitate use of the message system for personal and organizational       information management.   Message Body      The user should be able to place up to 300 disk pages of information in       the message body field.  The user should be able to format the message       text in any manner desired, using the editing commands available in the       message system or commands accessible in a more comprehensive system with      which the message system may be integrated.      The full text of the message should be delivered to all recipients except      where limited distribution is specified by the sender.  In those cases,       the full text of the specified message should be available as recorded       messages in the library.  In such cases, only header information and       other necessary fields, such as the location of the library copy of the       full text, would be sent to the addressees.   Message Categories      User-named message categories should be able to be created by commands so      that users may store messages in ways that meet their own particular       needs for later retrieval and review.   Message Drafts      The message system should enable users to prepare drafts of messages that      may be sent at a later time.  These drafts of messages should be stored       for future use and should be easily accessed, further edited if       necessary, and sent in the normal manner.      Users should be able to add or delete optional fields, edit existing       text, or enter new text at any stage of the message preparation process       after supplying the text for required fields.   Pre-specified Message Forms      The message system should provide the capability for users to prepare       message forms in advance for later input to the message system.  Any or       all of the optional message fields should be part of such message forms       and should be selectable and ordered at the user's option.  Upon each       user submission of a message form to the message system, the system       should prompt for any fields that contain no pre-entered data and should       complete the message sending process in the normal manner.   Blank Entries In Fields      The message system should accept blank entries in all fields other than       the required fields that must contain entries.  Fields omitte„!from the       message should be considered to have been designated as blank by the0      sender.   Message Privacy      Each message should by default be private to and viewable only by the       sender, the recipients of the message, and others designated by the       sender.   Signatures      The system should facilitate the verifiable placement of "signatures" on       messages and documents where appropriate.   Spelling Correction      The message system should provide the capability for users to check and       correct the spelling of text in messages.  This should be available in       both interactive and "batch" modes and accessible within the message       system or optionally accessible within the overall office information       system if such exists.   Identification System      The message system should have an extensive Identification system where       all relevant information about each user and his/her address is stored.        This information should be accessible to the message system for       verification and distribution purposes and to users to support the       addressing process.   Looking Up User Identifications/Addresses      Users should be able to locate and view specific user information on the       basis of: individual identification codes, last name, and Soundex text.   Distribution Lists      Users should be able to prepqre their own distribution lists and submit4      them to the message system for use in message disôsibution.  In addition,      the identification system should provide the capability for users to       designate "official" list names and associated user identifications as       distribution lists.   Verifying Distribution Lists      The message system should verify all addresses in distribution lists (for      the message system) and inform the sender of any non-valid addresses       specified: LafiteSupport.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 16-Apr-85 13:02:15Machine: Dandelion (Orion1)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 5777The new Find feature in Lafite is a big help to those of us who keep humungo mail files - and it's fast too!

If it finds one without a space, use that instead.  Alternatively, the gv/ns gateway, which certainly does have clearinghouse code, could massage names going thru the gateway.I suppose I could kludge up Lafite to effectively do the same.  If there is any address in the message containing a @, then use the spaceless alias in the From field instead of the canonical name.  I don't in general like sending NS mail with an alias in the From field, since then there is no quick way the receiver can know whether the From field and the actual sender of the message are the same, and therefore know that the sender field ("Originator") is superfluous.Doesn't Star have this problem worse?  Or does Star let you log in using an alias, and keep that alias as your From field?	Bill*start*01870 00024 US Date:  3 May 85 17:48:08 PDTFrom: Murray.paSubject: Re: [Murray.pa: Mail gateway news and plea for help]In-reply-to: "vanMelle's message of 3 May 85 16:37 PDT"To: vanMelleCc: Masinter, LafiteSupport, MurrayFirst, the easy parts. Cedar doesn't have any Clearinghouse code. Getting Al Hall to fix the gv/ns gateway is a lost cause. I can't (yet) get him/them to fix the stupid bug that's injecting a lot of mail into my mailbox, and I've been screaming about it for months. (It will take a bit of work.) It doesn't yet to anything spacial about Arpa names, so adding that sort of hack is a bit evil.At the time that I did the space/underbar hack, I convinced myself it would work. It's working only on the names within the envelope, and it knows which direction things are going, so it knows that all the names it's processing ar GV names. I'm willing to claim I'm the GV czar and tell anybody that they can't have a backarrow in their name (or put one in a DL name). Actually, you can do it, you just have to make an alias with a space in it.Now that I think of it, this might actually fail. Consider a user out there somplace in Arpa land that sends a msg to one of our DLs with Arpa people on it. If that persons name has a space, I'll turn it into an underbar. (It gets complicated by the Owners- hackery.)Headers are more complicated. There isn't any easy way to tell if a name is local or not. Thus I might "fix" a name that shouldn't get fixed.Tajo lets you log in using an alias, and then the MailTools (aka NSHardy) uses that alias in the From field. I don't know what Star does.The bottom line is that many Unix systems are allergic to names containing spaces. If you want to send them mail and you also want to be able to send mail to people whos systems have spaces in their names, things are going to get interesting.*start*00831 00024 US Date:  7 May 85 11:15 PDTFrom: Newman.pasaSubject: Lafite: File Server down confuses LafiteTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Newman.pasaLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 24-Apr-85 19:03:36Machine: Dandelion (25200066464)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 5777Frequency: IntermittentImpact: MinorTrying to browse a Lafite mail file on a server that is not responding causes Lafite to go into the "click left to confirm creation of XXX.mail" routine.

Veizades's message of 27 Jun 85 13:46:23 PDT (Thursday)Text: The following is a message that's been sent many times now:The mail system should not be used to transfer large amounts of data, unless there is a very good reason to do so. The fact that mailing works better than filing is NOT a very good reason. Among the reasons the mail service should not be used for file transfer are:   1) Posting large messages to the nearby mail service can fill up its database. This database will remain full until the large message is delivered. This can take a substantial amount of time - the transfer of the message doesn't go any more smoothly than a filing transfer, the mail service just keeps trying until it succeeds. While the local mail service database is full, other messages cannot be posted to it, and somebody else's mail service does the majority of the work of sending messages for the rest of the users who normally would use the nearby mail service. Point 3) below points out other effects of a full mail service database.      2) Transfer of the large message might take a long time, especially if it is being delivered to a destination many hops away. Once this transfer starts, shorter messages that are ready to be transferred have to wait until the transfer of the large message is finished. This means that the senders of the short messages perceive degraded service.    3) The receiving mail service's database can fill up upon receipt of a large message - mail service databases are not nearly as large as file services. This condition will persist until the large message is read by ALL of the recipients. This can take days or weeks depending on how conscientious the recipients of the message are. During the time that the database is full, this mail service cannot receive more mail. If this condition persists for two working days, messages destined for this mail service will be returned to their senders.  Jody*start*00548 00024 US Date: 10 Jul 85 10:42 PDTFrom: BrianSmith.paSubject: Lafite: Bad.State.For.BoutTo: LafiteSupport.PAcc: BrianSmith.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Jun-85 10:24:28Machine: Dorado (Koyaanisqatsi)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 40000Frequency: OnceImpact: seriousAfter an interminably slow "get mail" (servers slow, I presume), I got the following error:	BSP error: BAD.STATE.FOR.BOUT	{STREAM}#64,175150	...under an Ms.retrieveoperation, under a gv.nextmessage.??Brian*start*00958 00024 US Date: 10 Jul 85 10:49 PDTFrom: card.paSubject: Lafite: Deadly embrace for files with bad volumeTo: LafiteSupport.PAcc: card.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Jun-85 10:24:28Machine: Dandelion (Halasz1)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 13777Frequency: AlwaysImpact: FatalIf DEFAULTHOST&DIR is defined in an INIT.LISP file for one system, e.g. {DSK}<LISPFILES>MAIL> and the user attempt to start a new lisp on a machine that has a different logical volume name for files, e.g. {DSK}<PRIVATEFILES>, then an attempt to browse will break because of unknown file name even though the system itself has just been the one to define the new folder.

Resetting LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&DIR isn't enough.   (in fact, I already had done that).  Once you get into this state, you can't Quit out of Lafite, because it will insist on having the password of the previous user before you can quit.

I had reloaded my init.lisp, which hadn't fixed the problem, but I didn't do a GREET, that was a good suggestion.3. I understand Lafite's problem, but can't quite agree.  This is an instance of a hidden interface variable--something the user has to know or (eventually) find in the manual which critically affects the interpretation of his commands.  Some cue to such a variable ought to be displayed on the browser or lafite icons such that (1) I notice it's not what I want and (2) I can change it by pointing to it and typing a new one.

I think image objects are backwards. Right now, the text has the data, and the "imageobj" descriptor says how to interpret it. If, instead, the text just said "[bitmap]" and the imagedata part said to interpret it as (lots of bits) then "unformatted" messages wouldn't be filled with garbage.     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----From: Deutsch.paDate:  2-Aug-85 10:01:36 PDTSubject: Representation of pictures in Lafite mailTo: LispSupport.paApparently Lafite appends picture information to the text part of the message.This produces large amounts of garbage on mail systems that don't follow itsconventions.

That's not so bad; until you want to read your own mail, or close their file. Lafite hangs, waiting for you to type in the other person's password, before it will let you close/kill their LAFITE. Of course you could boot out of the sysout, but who knows what damage that does to their mail system. Ergo: one useless machine.LAFITE should force the user to close all their folders before allowing them to log out. It would be nice if it would also allow you to reset the LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&DIR *after* it has re-initialized.Marcel*start*01788 00024 US Date: 11 Aug 85 15:18 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: divide by 0 in \SHAREOFXTRAYTo: LafiteSupport, LispSupport, Format: TEditwhen reshaping the Lafite menu.      à 5                            F                           F                                          €          <   à     1€  °    Ãà~Ff   0     1€   0  0Ã FpyïƒÏ±|ğ1¾8Æq³™à|Ã<<Í™³æm±³m1³Æ°ÌÛ00 ÇÆÍ™¿ ÷ì?aÀ1³<ly³ÌÛğ0 Æ`FÍ™° 60`p1³llÙ¶ÌÛ 60 À`FfÍ™³6l3a01³l8Ù¶ÌÛ060 Æf0|y™ãÌaà3>8}³ï™à ÃÆ0                           F                           F                                                                                 F                           F                                                      ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿÿÿóÿÿÿÿÿógÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿÿÿ?óşÿÿÿç<sÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿÿÿ?ÿşÿÿÿæ|sÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿ‡şóüğÿÎÌùÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿ3ÿ?óşç?ÿÎÌùÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿóÿ?óşç?ÿÎpÌùÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿƒÿ?óşà?ÿÎ|íùÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿ3ÿ?óşçÿÿÎ|áùÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÏÿ3ÿ?óşç?ÿÏ8óùÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÀÿ‰ÿ?óÿğÿç„óóÿÿÿÿÿÿGÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿçÿÿóÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿóÿÿçÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿF                           F                      `    à       <  08à     `    0       f  08à    1€   F 7Ï33Ï   pyñğ=ç    1³o€  F æÙ³6Y€  <Í›0=á›    1³f    6›g€  ı›07g›    1³f    6ŸáØ   Á›07m›    1³f   F 6ŒÄÙ€  fÍ›07m›    5³f   F æÇ   |y™ğ2gÛ    c€                                                 €    F                           Gÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ              I have (OVERFLOW T) set.        TIMESROMAN            ¤      Ö  BMOBJ.GETFN2          • zº*start*00442 00024 USaDate: 19 Aug 85 09:44 PDTFrom: Grimble.paSubject: Lafite: Messages redisplay themselves several times after you choose DeliverTo: LafiteSupport.PALafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 16-Aug-85 08:01:07Machine: Dandelion (Grimble)Microcode version: 26,32Memory size: 15777Frequency: IntermittentImpact:  Minor creating a rippling effect in the message window that I find annoying.Fran*start*00454 00024 US Date: 25 Aug 85 17:00 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Messages redisplay themselves several times after you choose DeliverIn-reply-to: Grimble.pa's message of 19 Aug 85 09:44 PDTTo: Grimble.pacc: LafiteSupport.PAI've never noticed such a redisplay, unless you count the scrolling back to the beginning of the message (which is a feature, and even so happens but once, not several times).

Every time I bring up a new sysout, I have to get out the lafite manual and read through it until I finally come across how to set it.  There are several ways to do it, but the problem is that they are not obvious at the time the user has the problem.Here are a couple ideas:*1.  If Lafite comes up with LAFITEMODEDEFAULT NIL, then the bottom menu consists of SetMode and Quit or perhaps Browse SetMode and Quit (i.e. only those actions that make sense).  SetMode gets a popup menu to set the mode (maybe like middlebuttonQuit).2.  If that isn't acceptable, at least when the user buttons SendMail, giving the "mode not set" message, it could also at that time pop up the menu to set the mode.Since you know at both these points that the user needs to use the set mode command, you could solve the "secret command" problem by invoking the command at that point (or at least naming it in the error message).--stu*start*00600 00024 USaDate: 26 Aug 85 12:40 PDTFrom: Sybalsky.paSubject: Re: A question regarding Star and Lisp InterfaceIn-reply-to: lehner.PA's message of 21 Aug 85 16:28:33 PDT (Wednesday)To: lehner.PAcc: Sybalsky.PA, AHenderson.PA, VanmelleBill VanMelle's the guy in charge of our mail system.

I'm planning to change Lafite so that it can retrieve mail attachments in a way that allows at least some very simple manipulation.  For example, you could retrieve an Interpress attachment and be able to print it.  Or you could retrieve a Star document as an attachment, store it on a file server, and have some Star user be able to access it.	Bill*start*00721 00024 USaFrom: deutsch.paDate: 26-Aug-85 13:01:41 PDTSubject: Re: Rotation of bitmapsIn-reply-to: Gocek.henr's message of 26 Aug 85 15:30 EDTTo: Gocek.henrcc: LispFolklore^.xLisp people:PLEASE DO NOT SEND MESSAGES TO PUBLIC DLS WITH BITMAPS EMBEDDED IN THEIR PLAINTEXT PORTION.

Thus, you could use it for sending mail, I think, but not for retrieving, which would probably best be done by some sort of snarfing the mail file (via FTP) for the user from the mainframe host and parsing it out into Lafite format.It's possible there are folks already working on such a thing, since I've sketched the same strategy to others, but I have no current status on such projects.	Bill*start*04953 00024 US Date:  2 Sep 85 18:31 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: [kevin@MIT-SLOAN.MIT.EDU: My Mail server]To: lafitesupportfyi     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----Return-Path: <@MIT-MC.ARPA:kevin@MIT-SLOAN.MIT.EDU>Received: from MIT-MC.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 14 AUG 85 16:17:47 PDTReceived: from MIT-SLOAN.MIT.EDU by MIT-MC.ARPA 14 Aug 85 19:15:05 EDTFrom: kevin@MIT-SLOAN.MIT.EDUcc: kevin@MIT-SLOAN.MIT.EDU, kevin@harvard.ARPATo: masinter.pa, root%bostonu.csnet@MIT-SLOAN.MIT.EDU, zoll@cmu-psy-a.ARPA, BRAD@SU-CSLI.ARPA, ricsk%ucbic@UCB-VAX.ARPASubject: My Mail serverSender: Date: 14 Aug 85 19:11Thank you for your interest in our SMTP server.  Beforeyou get too excited about it, however, I want to describeit more fully so you know what to expect (and what not toexpect).RequirementsThe SMTP server runs under the Intermezzo release ofInterLisp.  It requires the TCP/IP package that wasrecently released and a few other library packages.It uses LAFITE and NS Mail to handle delivery locally,so you need an NS server running the NS Mail servicesomewhere also.The server currently runs on an 1108.  It is setup to runin the background, so it could be run on someone's machine,as long as they don't want to read mail and don't mindoccasional pauses while the server does something.  Weintend to dedicate one machine to running the server; forthat reason, we have the server setup to print statusmessages on an ADM3a terminal, to automaticallylog itself in, etc.  (The server machine will not have akeyboard and display screen.)FunctionalityThe server handles both incoming and outgoing mail.Basically, it serves as a bridge between NS Mail andInternet Mail.  The design was motivated by several factors:1)  we wanted something soon that would work for all of    the systems that we use (i.e. Star, XDE, Lisp, PCs)2)  we didn't want to rewrite any of the other mail programmes3)  we didn't know the mail server protocol, so all we could do   was send and receive messagesIncoming mail is easiest.  The server listens for a TCP/IP connectionon the SMTP socket.  When a connection is made, it handlesthe SMTP dialogue and uses LAFITE to send the receivedmessage to the final recipient via NS Mail.  This part of the system works just like any other SMTPmail receiver; the only real problem is getting the new sitename registered with some name server (hence my returnaddress, kevin%mit-sloan.mit.edu@mit-mc; only mit-mcknows where to find us, at least until domains work).Outgoing mail is a bit of a kludge.  Since we couldn't modifyany of the other mailers, nor intercept messages goingbetween mail servers, we require that the sender include theaddress "ARPA" (the name of the SMTP mail server's mailbox)as one of the recipients of the message.  We take advantageof the fact that most of the mailers can be told to simplyignore illegal addresses in the destination of a letter.Therefore, if I send a message like:	To: kevin, kevin@harvard.arpa, arpathe message will be delivered locally to kevin and arpa, andthe invalid (for NS Mail) "kevin@harvard.arpa" willbe ignored.  When the SMTP mail server reads the mail inits mailbox, it finds this letter, notices that theaddress "kevin@harvard.arpa" is not local (but kevin andarpa are), and forwards a copy of the message to"kevin@harvard.arpa" using SMTP and TCP/IP. Ironically, LAFITE is the only mail programme thatwon't allow any illegal addresses.  To accomodate this,we also allow To: and cc: fields in the first lines of thetext, (as was done in this message).Currently the programme is setupto forward mail via some local smart machine (MIT-MC),although it would be trivial to force it to deliver directly.The advantage of using a smart host to forward mail aremany: the host table on the 1108 can be smaller, domainscan be handled correctly, the smart host will retry if thedestination is down (the 1108 server doesn't bother),only one copy of the message needs to be sent, etc.This programme is being offered as-is.  We can notsupport it in anyway (aside from distributing anybug fixes others may send us) and we have no plans towork on it any further.  It mostly works, but could standto be smarter about handling errors (currently it simplyreturns the letter and let's the sender figure out whatto do), etc.  We intend to distribute sources, so youshould be able to make any changes you want or needfor your local environment.I'm still waiting to hear ifthere are any legal obstacles to distributing the programme,so I can't even give you a firm date for distribution,although I hope it will be soon.If you are still interested in this programme, please dropme another note, so I can try try to speed up therelease.Kevin CrowstonMIT Sloan School of Managementkevin%mit-sloan.mit.edu@mit-mc.arpakevin@harvard.arpa     ----- End Forwarded Messages -----*start*00728 00024 USaDate:  6 Sep 85 17:24 PDTFrom: Kahn.paSubject: Lafite: Indentation in messages sent out over the ArpanetTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Kahn.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 12-Aug-85 19:51:40Machine: Dorado (Linne)Microcode version: 26,30Memory size: 40000Frequency: >> Always, Intermittent, Once <<Impact: ModerateFrequently I want to send out messages to the arpanet that contain indentation.

However, note that the arpanet gateway looks at your message and automatically inserts cr's to break up long lines (somewhere around column 65-72, I think), unless you put a magic line in the header, something like "Line-fold: No".  Of course, any message that passes thru the arpanet and this line folding may appear junky in a sufficiently narrow Lafite window.So what to do?  (a) always send plain-text only messages to arpanet.  (b) if you want something indented, do it by hand with spaces and cr's.  It's not grossly difficult to write a Tedit macro that will do this.  Gregor has also requested same, so if nobody gets around to it before I have some spare time, I might write such a macro.	Bill*start*01068 00024 USaDate:  5 Sep 85 15:55 PDTFrom: levy.paSubject: Announcing MAIL-SORTER packageTo: LispUsers^.pacc: levy.paReply-to: levy.paMAIL-SORTER is a new LISP package that will automatically sort mail into folders according to a set, prespecified set of rules. It allows you to create a set of rules that will select messages that meet certain criteria (such as  "If the message is to ISL^.pa"), and then take some action on those messges (such as MOVE, DELETE, and MARK). These rules can be applied to incoming mail, so that it is sorted before you even begin to browse it. They can also be used to sort existing folders.I would like users of this package to send me comments about its use, it being part of my thesis work. Are the rules "unnatural"? Is it too difficult to use? Does it not help solve some basic problem of mail handling or sorting?The package is located on {QV}<PIMP>MAIL-SORTER.DCOM and it is (supposedly well) documented on {QV}<PIMP>MAIL-SORTER>TEDIT.

messages.  I plowed through them all, deleting most but not all.  I don't remember for sure but I think I did an update-expunging deleted messages.  While I was at lunch my machine crashed.  I didn't have time to look at it then so came in on Sunday.  When I started Sunday, the VM was clean from before Friday (8Meg) and the message survey window showed the state as of before Friday.  I forgot that the mail system might be messed up and did a get mail.  It put the new mail at the end of surveyed mail, overwriting the messages I had saved from Friday.

File open for write.2.  SAVEVM3.  Write some more on file.4.  Crash.  Restore as of the SAVEVM.  File system compares file's creationdate as known in core with the current creationdate given by the file server, finds them the same and fails to flush its internal state about the file (in particular, where eof is).Bug is that the creationdate didn't change when you did the second set of writes, because most devices set it but once, at the time you open the file.  Lafite is a prime candidate for this bug.  To be a victim, you would have to have had your mail file open for write before the SAVEVM (say, because you got mail but hadn't expunged), then write more after the SAVEVM (get mail or expunge) and never close and reopen (for write) the file before the crash.Thing is, I'm pretty sure I fixed this bug in at least some of the devices.  Looks at least superficially like it's ok on {DSK}.  When Eris comes back up I'll check others.  Was your mail file on dsk or ifs?	Bill*start*00289 00024 US Date: 24 Sep 85 12:20 PDTFrom: Burton.paSubject: Re: Lafite: mail overwritten?In-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 24 Sep 85 12:04 PDTTo: vanMelle.pacc: LafiteSupport.PAIt was no dsk.

No, there is nothing to worry about here.  Clicking Get Mail while a Get Mail is in progress indeed sprouts a second Get Mail process, but the two are interlocked, so that the second waits for the first to complete.  Thus, it is like clicking Get Mail right after the first Get Mail completes.On the other hand, Lafite should probably suppress most menu clicks during Get Mail, just to reduce confusion.	Bill*start*00749 00024 US Date: 30 Sep 85 14:31 PDTFrom: Rhoades.paSubject: Lafite FindTo: vanMellecc: Rhoades.paI have a msg entry from  "Cutting.pa" in my lafite browser, which I have moved to another location, and this is indicated by a line through the msg and the "m" in the margin.

It presumably was sent via NS mail and then passed thru the NS to GV gateway, whence I retrieved it.It seems to have had some NS chars in it, but they show up as black boxes in the message display.  I copy-selected some of the characters in to the Exec window to see what character codes they were.  Lo and behold, the first character I looked at was code 255.This suggests that the message came in in run-coded form, but that somehow that didn't get noticed when it got stuck in the Tedit window.Whose responsibility is it to detect and do that conversion?  Presumably, if I have a simple plain-text file that has runcodes in it, Tedit will do the conversion as it reads the characters in.  (Haven't tried that).  Should Lafite be doing something, or is it using TEDIT.INCLUDE, which doesn't do the right thing?Here is a brief sample copy-selected from my message:henÿ)ÿ .

I propose that we find or build the following:1) a program that copies all the contents from a mailbox file on TURINGinto a file on the local disk, does whatever formatting changes arenecessary to convert from TOPS-20 mail file format to something LAFITEcan swallow, then hands it to LAFITE.  It also needs to (in an atomicway) delete the contents of the TURING mail file.2) a program that takes a message (as composed and formatted by LAFITE)and delivers it to TURING so that it can be sent as mail there.a) The nicest would be something automatic -- i.e., when the file goesacross, it happens in a way that sets things up for the TOPS-20 mailerto handle it.b) Second best would be to put it into a file there which can beexecuted in some simple way by a person or program logged on throughCHAT (i.e., during or after using Lafite to "send" mail, I could logonand say "DO REALMAILSENDER" or some such, which would make it happen.)c) Worst, but most obviously implementable would be to have the LAFITEmailer feed things into files on Turing so that by later logging on Icould get them sent by explicitly using MAIL, using ^B to insert files,etc.On the Turing end, it would be nice if there were direct protocols (Idon't know how the MAIL program actually gets things mailed, but it musttalk to the operating system somehow).  Otherwise some combination ofusing FTP and TELNET connections from the Dandelion, with generatingexec command files, etc. should work.On the Dandelion end this of course all depends on getting into thesource code for LAFITE.  I don't know what the legal/moral/operationalstatus of all that is, but it should be clear before we try to doanything.  Otherwise we have to forget LAFITE and build something of ourown that does basic mailing functions and handles the TOPS-20 mailformat.Any thoughts? --t-------*start*00929 00024 US Date: Wed, 16 Oct 85 17:07:25 PDTFrom: Tribble.paSubject: Re: Handling mail on our DandelionsIn-Reply-To: "WINOGRAD@SU-CSLI.ARPA's message of Wed, 16 Oct 85 15:26:44 PDT"To: Terry Winograd <WINOGRAD@SU-CSLI.ARPA>cc: brad@SU-CSLI.ARPA, briansmith, vanmelleI've spoken to Bill vanMelle.  There is no existing SMTP interface to Lafitte or Interlisp, but Eric Shoen - the implementor of the TCP/IP code that does exists - supposedly cobbled together an SMTP mail sender.  I don't know the state of that program, but I'll try to find out tomorrow afternoon.  Bill told me that the idea of dragging a mail file over from a mainframe is the method currently being considered for interfacing Lafitte to big machines.

I have found Lafite an extremely bug-free, easy to use, reliable piece of software.  I would therefore be very hesitant to endorse any solution which proposed building something new in its place.2.  Given that many of us use TEdit extensively, any solution we adopt should be able to distribute TEdit format mail messages, which aren't simple ASCII files.  This capability is very useful (particularly for sending formal language stuff), and I find the inability to send such messages from PARC to Stanford a considerable hindrance.Brian*start*01200 00024 US Date: 18 Oct 85 12:04 PDTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: ["Bruce Hamilton".OsbuSouth: Need info on LISP mail-handling]To: LafiteSupport.paCan you answer Bruce's question number 2?     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----Sender: "Bruce A.

I would like not to leave LISP users out in the cold.  Please tell me (1) approx. how many LISP-only users (i.e. no XDE or ViewPoint) users there are on the Internet, and (2) whether there are any peculiarities with the way LISP handles NS mail.  For instance, XDE's mailtool takes a MailNote with a simple-text attachment and concatenates them into one big message invisibly to the user, which is very convenient.  I'll be less inclined to tell folks to broadcast giant type text messages like that if LISP does something weird like throws away the attachment.Thanks,--Bruce     ----- End Forwarded Messages -----*start*01347 00024 US Date: 29 Jan 86 15:56 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: ["Bruce Hamilton".OsbuSouth: Need info on LISP mail-handling]In-reply-to: Raim.pasa's message of 18 Oct 85 12:04 PDTTo: Raim.pasacc: LafiteSupport.paSorry for the delay; this message must have gotten buried in a Koto craze.Bruce asks "whether there are any peculiarities with the way LISP handles NS mail.  For instance, XDE's mailtool takes a MailNote with a simple-text attachment and concatenates them into one big message invisibly to the user, which is very convenient.  I'll be less inclined to tell folks to broadcast giant type text messages like that if LISP does something weird like throws away the attachment."I think Lisp is fairly similar to XDE here.  Details:Lisp sends mail as either a mail note (for messages less than 8000 characters) or as "text", which I believe in Star terminology is the same as "blank mail note with plain text attachment".  Messages containing font or other formatting are sent similarly, with the formatting as a separate attribute.  Lisp reads mail sent in the form of a mail note and/or a plain text body, concatenating the two if a message contains both.  Lisp reads only the mail note portion of a message with non-plaintext attachment, leaving the entire message in the user's inbox for a Star to retrieve.*start*00693 00024 US Sender: "Donald W.

Currently, I plan to make the Basic Workstationuser agent as similar to Tajo's MailTool [hardy] as is humanlypossible.

For example, can the average Lisp user discriminate {Language, Operating System, Programming Environment} or {Bootstrap/installation Env, Hardware, Microcode}?  Those that do know, I claim, also know how to submit AR's, which is your preferred way of submitting bug reports, yes?In other words, it's not clear to me you're adding anything but noise to the form, while adding one more thing in the path of folks who are already confused about submitting bug reports.If you still think this will help more than hurt, you might consider making it a little more compact, and grouping related categories together.

The reason for suggesting this change in the form at all is to get some more beneficial use out of the lisp report form.  As it stands, it is an inefficient alternative to direct submition of ar's, which many still use, and is tacitly encouraged by our including it in the lafite forms options.  Unfortunately, all such submissions must be manually screened.  My hope is that by introducing some level of discrimination into the form itself,  we can more effectively screen, sort and respond to comments, questions and bug reports.  While your point that average users  may not be able to critically differentiate among these arbitrary distinctions is sensible, an attempted guess on their part is better than none.  The plan we are moving toward is to partition LispSupport among the test team members, according to their area of focus.  I hope this will expedite the turnaround, improve their technical skills and insulate development from having to provode that level of support to everyone else.Gary*start*00893 00024 US Date: 23 Oct 85 11:14 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite Lisp formIn-reply-to: Rhoades.pa's message of 23 Oct 85 09:47 PDTTo: Rhoades.pacc: vanMelle.paI suppose you could get some benefit that way, at least to the extent that if someone is having problems with a LispUsers package it probably won't go to the person in charge of fielding Microcode bug reports.  As long as you don't have two different people on closely related topics (or it's easy for them to pass reports off to each other), it's fine.Now that we've compacted the list that far, we could compact it a little further so that each category is one "word" from TEdit's point of view:Category: >>Language, ProgrammingEnvironment, OperatingSystem, Library, LispUsers, Servers, Microcode, Installation, Hardware<<(Mainly I got rid of "Bootstrap", a term not useful to most people.)	Bill*start*01003 00024 US Date: 23 Oct 85 14:44 PDTFrom: Feuerman.pasaSubject: Lafite: LOGOUT when File server is downTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Feuerman.pasaLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Jun-85 10:24:28Machine: Dandelion (206#30#)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 17777Frequency: AlwaysImpact: SeriousIf you keep your mail files on a file server, and that file server goes down, you cannot LOGOUT of Interlisp-D.  The problem is that apparently LOGOUT forces some LAFITE.AROUNDEXITFNs to be called, which try to close any open mail files.  This can't be done if the mail file is on the downed file server.  Instead of giving up and continuing on with the LOGOUT, though, a break window comes up complaining about the problem, and tells the user to keep trying.  If the file server is still down, though, there is no way to tell it to stop trying to close the file and LOGOUT anyway.  This has caught a number of rather naive users in a tremendous bind.--Ken.*start*21759 00024 US Date: 29 Oct 85 08:17 PSTFrom: Rclarke.pasaSubject: Lafite: CAN'T HANDLE BROKEN FILE SERVER CONNECTIONTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Rclarke.pasaLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Jun-85 10:24:28Machine: Dandelion (207#50#)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 5777Frequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousOccasionally when a file server goes down and than comes up again, a Lafite mailfolder that was open during that time reports a File server broken connection and can no longer be updated. Even trying to update a local disk mailfolder gives the same message for the mailfolder that was on the file server.  You cannot even logout.  In the break window you need to do a (RETFROM 'CLOSEF) or a (RETFROM 'FORCEOUTPUT) to get started again.  Before I found this the only other way to get restarted was to reload a fresh sysout.Example:{dante}<rclarke>read.mail had been used to transfer mail to a mailfolder {dante}<rclarke>mccphonemail.  About a half hour after the transfer the file server went down.  Eventually the file server came up again.  Since the folder had never been closed I could read mail in the read.mail folder, but when I tried to update it I got the message File server connection broken on {dante}<rclarke>mccphone.mail.  I the openned another mail folder on my local disk  read in some new mail, again did update, and received the same message as before about mccphone.mail.  Same thing occurs on trying to close mccphone.mail.  I then scavenged mccphone.mail, did  update, got the break and then did (RETFROM 'CLOSEF).  I was then able to update all of the other folders.A fix to this type of situation would be appreciated.  A dribble file of the break follows.NIL25:BT!ERROR\LEAF.REPAIR.BROKEN.PUP\LEAF.FIX.BROKEN.SEQUINERRORSETPUTSEQUIN\SENDLEAF\LEAF.REQUESTPAGE\LEAF.READPAGES\READPAGESDOPMAP\MAPPAGE\PAGED.GETNEXTBUFFER\BUFFERED.BIN\BINLA.READSTAMPPARSEMAILFOLDER1PARSEMAILFOLDERLOADMAILFOLDERLAB.LOADFOLDERERRORSET\LAFITE.BROWSE.PROC\EVALFORMERRORSET\MAKE.PROCESS0T26:BTV!Basic

folder that I created and which has messages in it is not shown to me in the Browser or Move folder menus.  When I re-type the name of the Folder, after clicking Other, it tells me that it is an old

Could it be that the LAFITE.PROFILE file isn't getting updated properly?  Could it be that moving back and forth between Koto and Intermezzo is causing the profile to get screwed up.   On some folders I have gone around the loop more than once:  creating it, noting in a next sysout that it isn't in the menu, re-noting it with the Other command, then finding that in a new sysout it still isn't known.Is it something I'm doing?--Ron*start*01021 00024 USaSender: "Brenda L.

In order to correctly interpret dead letters which arrive in this mailbox, the SA needs a mail reading tool which can handle doubly nested envelopes (the original envelope, the return envelope which explains who didn't get the message and why, and the dead letter envelope which explains why the message couldn't be returned).  Unfortunately, none of the mail tools that we know of do this. Does yours?

The last example of this that comes to mind is a message Lissy Bland copied to CSL asking Eric Bier for a paper that Eric had mentioned in a message.

AUTOMATIC USE OF FROM / SENDER / REPLY-TO		For systems which automatically generate address lists for		replies to messages, the following recommendations are made:		o	If the "Reply-To" field exists, then the reply should			go to the addresses indicated in that field and not to			the address(es) indicated in the "From" field.		o	If there is a "From" field but no "Reply-To" field,			the reply should be sent to the address(es) indicated			in the "From" field.This is the same as part (1) of Carl Black's proposal.  The current Xerox convention is:			If there is no "Reply-To" field, the reply should be sent			to the address(es) indicated in the "From", "To" and "cc"			fields.In addition there seems to be a convention that confirmation is required in order to send to DLs without a "Reply-To" field.  (The Smalltalk mail interfaces also support this).I believe that the reason the Laurel implementors decided to do it this way was that it is easier to delete the additional addresses than to add them in manually.  Unfortunately it is easiest of all just to leave them there.I have some problems with this, and another proposal, which I will send out in my next message.-- Steve*start*01774 00024 US Date: Sat, 9 Nov 85 0:40:33 PSTFrom: Steve Putz <Putz.pa>Subject: A better message damping proposalIn-Reply-To: "Putz's message of Sat, 9 Nov 85 0:15:05 PST"To: Willie-Sue, Murray, JLarson, vanMelle, Donahue, Swinehartcc: BabarSupport^The thing I don't like about the current "confirm for no Reply-To" scheme is that the responsibility is placed on the wrong person.  It should be the responsibility of the replying user (and his mail interface) to compose an appropriate reply, not the original sender.  The current scheme protects the recipients from making a mistake, but not the sender!I propose a scheme where the mail interface is smart enough to notice whether any of the DLs in the message being sent were automatically copied from the original message.  If so, confirmation should be required.  This encourages the sender to consider whether the distribution is appropriate.  Right now it is too easy to think "If I let the machine add a 'Reply-To' now, I'm doing the right thing."The good news is that adding this feature to any of our mail interfaces will immediately benefit their users (protecting them from public embarrassment and ridicule), since this scheme does not depend on any conventions about "Reply-To" at all.There would be an additional benefit if most of our mail interfaces had this feature, since then we could get rid of the sometimes annoying automatic "Reply-To" confirmation/generation (For instance, there is a good chance that someone will accidently allow a "Reply-To" field to be added to a reply to this very message, since it now includes a DL.  This could easily cause people to get left out of the discussion).I'll add the feature I've described to Babar.

It allows you to create a set of rules that will select messages that meet certain criteria (such as  "If the message is to ISL^.pa"), and then take some action on those messges (such as MOVE, DELETE, and MARK). These rules can be applied to incoming mail, so that it is sorted before you even begin to browse it. They can also be used to sort existing folders.MailSorter has been tested and now runs in Koto. People who have used it in Intermezzo so far have found it useful in cutting through a large amount of incoming mail, as well as in finding pieces of mail in large folders.MailSorter has now also been integrated with NoteCards, allowing users to specify messages that should be turned into NoteCards and stored in a Notefile.(Announcement of the "MailCards" package to follow).Any bugs, comments, please send to Levy.paSteve Levy.*start*01829 00024 US Date: 19 Nov 85 21:30 PSTFrom: Levy.paSubject: New LispUsers PackageTo: LispUsers^, PIMP^, NoteCards^cc: Levy.pa, Halasz.paReply-to: Levy.paPackages:{QV}<PIMP>MailCardsLAFITEInterface.DCOM{QV}<PIMP>MailCards.DCOMDocumentation for both:{QV}<PIMP>MailCards.TEDITThere are now two new LISP packages that help users deal with incoming mail. They are especially useful it you either use (1) NoteCards or (2) MailSorter, and twice as useful if you use both. These packages take messages and convert them into specialized notecards (called MailCards). The mailcards have links in place of text for the various fields of the message (i.e. From, To, cc, In-reply-to, etc.). In addition to the fileboxes the you specify, each message is automatically stored in a number of boxes; an "author" box, containing all the messages sent to you from the sender of the message, a "dl" box, containing all the messages you have received from a dl.One of the nicest things about it is the In-reply-to links. The system automatically links a message to the message it is in reply to (if it can find it). People can bring up notecards (browser cards) which contain the entire "conversation" (i.e. all messages that were sent in reply to others), and look at the various parts of a conversation.The packages and documentation are located on {QV}<PIMP>. The documentation file MailCards.TEDIT contains the documentation for both packages. The first, MailCards.DCOM, allows you to use the MailSorter to choose messages that you wish turned into MailCards. The second, MailCardsLAFITEInterface.DCOM, adds an item to the LAFITE browsers allowing you to point to messages you want turned into MailCards, and then clicking "MailCard" and having it happen.Any comments, bugs, etc. should be directed to me, Levy.pa*start*01022 00024 US Date: 26 Nov 85 17:46 PSTFrom: Lilly.paSubject: Lafite: "Save Form" can be confusingTo: LafiteSupport.PAcc: Lilly.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Nov-85 10:39:55Machine: Dandelion (Bucephalus)Microcode version: 26,32Memory size: 5777Frequency: AlwaysImpact: Minor, but . . .I have observed that secretaries (or new users of the system) are using "Save Form" as a way of "putting" something they have been working on, rather than using "Save Form" for saving special message forms.

When you return and attempt to retrieve your mail, the mail server must first pull said mail from the IFS back to its own disk.Unfortunately, there is no graceful failure mode in the Grapevine protocol in the case where the server has trouble talking to the IFS.  So instead the server unceremoniously breaks the connection.  Lafite, not expecting this turn of events, breaks with an error message BAD.STATE.FOR.BIN.

(183 msgs)" prompt, then break with the aforementioned error.The "workaround" seems to be "patience"--abort out of the break window with ^ (or close the window), then try to Get Mail sometime later and hope that the net and/or the servers are happier then.  Most people have reported success retrieving their mail no later than a few hours after the initial failure.	Bill*start*01065 00024 US Date: 12 Dec 85 16:13 PSTFrom: Card.paSubject: Lafite: Infinite Loop on UpdateTo: LafiteSupport.PAcc: Card.paFormat: TEditLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 22-Nov-85 11:32:58Machine: Dandelion (204#60#)Microcode version: 26,32Memory size: 15777Frequency: IntermittantImpact: SeriousSometimes on update, the system will go into an infinite loop.

The second change is that the left-button TEDIT menu is available on the window as though it is a standard Tedit editor - even though it is a read-only window. Not only that, but most of the Tedit functions work: I can put and get files, I can substitute characters,  and I can change the looks of parts of the text.>>DavePS Is there a reason why shrinking a message editor window automatically places the icon rather than letting the user interactively place it?

I liked the old way better, too, most of the time, but there are things to be said for the new way.  In particular, you can now change the looks of some or all of a message, and you can use TEdit's Find command to locate text within a large message.TEditSupport: Any comments on your intentions here?  Given that the window is Readonly, the only operations that really make any sense are Find and Put.  Looks is nice, though it really violates readonliness.  If you're going to permit selection, it should always be normal, not pending-delete.  And there are numerous ways that readonliness is being violated (you can Substitute, Move text out of the window, Include a file, etc).	Billp.s. Placing the icon is on the list of Lafite things to change.  You might possibly have complained about this during the brief interval when TEdit was interfering with Lafite's shrinking, prompting you for a TEdit icon position then ignoring it.*start*01481 00024 US Date: 13 Dec 85 18:13 PSTFrom: Kelley.paSubject: Lafite: MailSorter: FileCacher: combination deletes foldersTo: LafiteSupport.PA, Levy, Masintercc: Kelley.pa, Briggs, LanningLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date:  5-Dec-85 17:47:45Machine: Dandelion (131#33#)Microcode version: 26,32Memory size: 13777Frequency: IntermittentImpact: SeriousRelease: Koto.To loose your Lafite mail, give the mail sorter a mixed case folder name.  Then when you run with the FileCacher, the three subsystems manage to get confused in a destructive way.  (Especially if you "trust" the FileCacher" by letting it go ahead and use local files when the server does not respond).The problem seems to start with Lafite's insistance on destroying the case of folder names by forceing them all caps.  Then Steven's Mail Sorter comes along and allows folders with mixed case names.  Finally the FileCacher ignores the difference blithely automatically writing one version over the other depending on whether it is reading in or writing out.  I'm not sure if there would be a serious problem without trusting the filecacher running when the server is down.  Without filecacher there may just be a minor bug in Mail Sorter and everything works (Mixed case and all caps names will both appear in the Lafite Browse menu and point to the same file.)  But the problem could conceivably go away if only Lafite allowed mixed case folder file names. -- kirk *start*02974 00024 US Date: 15 Dec 85 20:58 PSTFrom: Levy.paSubject: LAFITE Patches and suchTo: VanMelle.pacc: Levy.paBill,I wanted to wirte and tell you what I had to do with LAFITE in order to make Mail Sorter and Mail Cards work.1. Mail Sorter:	The biggest problem in using LAFITE for Mail Sorter was "visibility". LAFITE wants a window for every things it does - deletion, hardcopying, moving, marking, etc. A lot of the Mail Sorter stuff is done in a "hidden folder", and does not have a window to update. What I did to overcome this was COPYYDEF many of the functions to function of the same name with the MS. prefix on it (i.e. SELECTMESSAGE became MS.SELECTMESSAGE). Whenever work was to be done on this hidden folder, the MS version was called. If it were to be done on a regular folder, it was done with normal LAFITE functions.	I also had to do something to put the mail in this hidden folder, and do the sorting before I came out of the "GetMail" proc. To do this, I had to change \LAFITE.GETNEWMAIL. Most of it is unchanged. It checks if the sorter is on. If it is, it gets the mail that same way it used to, but into a folder it develops as temporary. It then runs the rules over that folder, moves the leftover messages to the appropriate folder, and deletes the temporary folder. If the sorter is off, it calls \LAFITE.GETNEWMAILREG, which is a duplicate of the old \LAFITE.GETNEWMAIL.	Some patches had to be made to the code that produces the MailFoldersMenu, so that the #'s indicating the number of new messages could be stuck in there. It invloved the redef. of \LAFITE.PROMPTFORFOLDER. that is all.	I had to change \LAFITE.QUIT so that it would quit the sorter as well. Thats all the stuff involving the Mail Sorter. The patches are listed in {QV}<PIMP>MailSorterLafitePatches.2. MailCards:	Mail Cards only involved one patch into LAFITE. It had to redefine the BrowserMenuItems, so as to stick a "MailCard" command in there. That is in {QV}<PIMP>MailCardsLafiteInterface	I hope to have develop MailCards such that it will take the place of all of LAFITE's receivers tools. It should have a number of different browsers. The first will be much like the Lafite browser, except the items will be links (they can be brought up by clicking on them). The second, a ViewPoint Browser, will allow a user to quickly select different parameters of the mail he is looking up. It should have a "From" section, a "To:" section, a "Date" section, and will allow him select with the mouse different values for these fields, with the ability to OR, AND, and NOT the values. (Essentially, a nicer, "mouse-driven?" version of Mail Sorter , allowing the user to look up mail quickly. Finally, I want to have a Conversation browser, which will bring up a "conversation" - all the messages links by In-Reply-To fields.	I will keep working on this stuff at MIT. I just wanted to let you know what was going on, and how I interfaced to Lafite.Steve.*start*02679 00024 US Sender: "Donald W.

We are currently working on a new version of the mailing protocols.  If there are problems with our protocols that you would like to complain about, this is a good time.  When we have the final drafts, I expect that we'll circulate them.2.  The new inbasket protocol will better support reading mail from different workstations, by multiple users.  There is a question about how much of the mail user agent should be centralized on the mail service, and how much should be left to the individual implementors.  We currently want to centralize and store in each mailbox:  (a) The messages themselves.  This is the reason for the existence of the Inbasket protocol.  (b) The message status.  That is, whether or not the user has seen the message before in a table-of-contents (whether a message is "new" or "known").  (c) Whether the user has seen each body-part of a message.  That is, the "received" status [marked by a * in mailtool], except that it will be on a body part basis now, instead of a whole-message basis.  (d) Whether or not the user has reliably stored each body-part of a message [no parallel].  This would help users decide, when using different user agents, when it was safe to delete a multi-part message from a mailbox.  (e) Possibly, we might centralize a user-defined status (for mail filters use)3.  If your mailing user agent has a special need, or has a nifty low-level feature or wish-for-feature, I'd like to hear about it so we can consider whether or not we can do anything to assist you implementing this feature.  Here's an example:You want to play a different tune, or a different sound, whenever the amount of "new mail" in a user's mailbox changes.  This would constrain our protocol to provide an easy way to figure out exactly how many messages are "new", for both human-mailboxes, and shared-mailboxes.I would appreciate your comments, and I look forward to being able to circulate drafts of the new protocol.							Don*start*01067 00024 US Date: 19 Dec 85 15:25 PSTFrom: card.paSubject: Lafite: Infinite loop moving msgs to same folderTo: LafiteSupport.PA,LEVYcc: card.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 22-Nov-85 11:32:58Machine: Dandelion (204#60#)Microcode version: 26,32Memory size: 15777Frequency: AlwaysImpact: SeriousWhen the MAILSORTER is run on a message browser and some of the rules send messages to the same file browser, it apparently goes into an infinite loop at the end.Breaking it with the STOP button shows that it is inLA.COPY.MESSAGE.TEXT	MAILFOLDER	{MAILFOLDER}#56,157500	OUTPUTSTREAM	{STREAM}#54,65404	MSGDESCRIPPTOR	{LAFITEMSG}#63,111060	INSTREAM		{STREAM}#54,65404This command was called by MS.MOVEMESSAGESand it in turn calls COPYBYTES	*SRCFIL*	{STREAM}#54,65404	*DSTFIL*	{STREAM}#54,65404***Thus the problem is that if the MAILSORTER does a MOVEMESSAGES to the same folder (MAILFOLDER = DESTINATIONFOLDER) this apparently causes COPYBYTES to read and write from the same stream simultaneously.--stu*start*00581 00024 US Date: 30 Dec 85 11:16 PSTFrom: DMRussell.paSubject: Lafite: Ungraceful when file server crashesTo: LafiteSupport.PALafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Jun-85 10:24:28Machine: Dorado (Russell)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 40000Frequency: AlwaysImpact: Serious If I have an open mail folder, say {QV}<DMRUSSELL>ACTIVE.MAIL, and QV crashes, how do I easily get rid of my mail folder?

There are two editions:  an internal edition and a customer edition.  The only real difference between the two is that the internal edition has an extra appendix that describes Xerox-specific aspects of using Lafite and the network, including switching between Grapevine and NS modes, using Grapevine Maintain, and sending ARPANET messages.  The internal edition also has different versions of the title page, table of contents, glossary, quick-reference section, and index.  The title page gives the part number for the internal edition, and the TOC lists the heads in the additional appendix.  The glossary, quick-reference section, and index do not differ at all in content from those of the customer edition; they just have different page numbers to reflect the additional pages.  Probably most Xerox users will want the internal edition. The files for both editions are available in TEdit and Interpress format.  I am listing only the IP files (for brevity's sake) in the order in which they are assembled to make a manual.
