Doesn't seem like it ought to.2) It is still the case that if I hold the mouse down inside a browser and then move out of the browser before letting up, my selection is changed, more or less as if I had let up just before leaving the window.  This seems wrong--the selection should revert to what it was before I clicked down.  My recollection is that at least Laurel does it right.	Bill*start*00455 00024 USaDate:  2 Oct 83 17:54 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: Display after deleteTo: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 29-SEP-83 15:17:12Lisp-System-Date: 30-SEP-83 16:37:09Machine-Type: DoradoI think this one should still skip deleted messages.

In particular I just found three messages which were lost to me for two weeks.  Apparently they were incorrectly identified as having been sent in January, and thus stached near the beginning of my Active file, where I seldom look.I must say I still favor the old scheme of putting new mail at the end with a mark (or emphasis such as bold or underline) that indicates unread mail.The presentation of new mail is confusing to me.  This is particularly due to use of strike-out for having-been-read, and there being no indication for delete.Regarding select-next-after-delete, I find it disconcerting in cases other than when the next message is unread.I include, for your amusement more than anything else, the following scenario which I experienced in which all three above features of Fillet seemed to gang up against me:While reading my New Mail, I read a message A about a meeting, and then, farther down I read a cancellation A' of the meeting.  I deleted the cancellation A', [this then advanced to the next message B, which I ignored because I] selected the original message A and deleted that also.  Here's where it got interesting.  The delete of A zooped down past B [because it was already read (by the machine, not me)] to the next message C.  But, I knew I wanted to see B, so I ignored C and selected B.  I read B and decided to delete it;  but guess what happened:  now C got skipped because it had been looked at, etc., etc."Almost everyone in Philadelphia reads The Bulletin."	- Dan*start*00456 00024 US Date: Mon, 3 Oct 83 11:38:43 PDTFrom: Zdybel.PASubject: Minor problem with LetterWriterTo: FilletSupport.PAcc: FilletUsers^.PAI find that when opening a LetterWriter by doing an "answer"in the mailbrowser (to a message sent to me specifically), I get cc: zdybel.PA, .PANo big deal, but I wish it would capitalize (the login name wascapitalized) and don't think it should insert the gratuitous ", .PA"on the end.Frank*start*00453 00024 US Date:  3 Oct 83 12:25 PDTFrom: Yonke.paSubject: Re: Lafite: From vs. SenderIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 29 Sep 83 18:52 PDTTo: vanMelle.pacc: Yonke.paFixed in the Lafite that is already in the 30th full.

It's hard to see how to reconcile this with the model of a (single) visible selection.  It's confusing in Laurel.It seems to me that Fillet can support this need fairly well by creating new message files.  You create a new file for printing or forwarding, then go "into" that file and say "print all" or "forward all";  commands which could be supported in the upper-left pane.  Repeated moves would be used a lot for this, and would thus want the support of a destination menu which knew its last selection.It may well be that the Laurel "marking" scheme is the best compromise;  but it would be nice not to confuse it with the "current selection" as badly as Laurel does.  I have a feeling some nifty graphics could help this situation.*start*00355 00024 US Date: Mon, 3 Oct 83 18:06:37 PDTFrom: Zdybel.PASubject: Re: Fillet Message SelectionsTo: Ingalls.pacc: Zdybel.PA, FilletSupport.PA, FilletUsers^.PAIn-Reply-To: "Ingalls.pa's message of Mon, 3 Oct 83 17:54:52 PDT"Or, once we get away from files, one would build up "extensional"filters (message sets) selection by selection.*start*01519 00024 US Date: Tue, 4 Oct 83 11:03:28 PDTFrom: Ingalls.paSubject: Re: Fillet Message SelectionsTo: Zdybel.PA, FilletSupport.PAcc: FilletUsers^.PAIn-Reply-To: "Zdybel.PA's message of Mon, 3 Oct 83 18:06:37 PDT"I have a solution to the apparent conflict between multiple selection and viewing a single selection.  The error which Laurel makes is not having an independent marking scheme for the currently viewed selection.Here's the solution:  items are displayed in a list pane just like the current one, but with a little column down the right-hand side, about the same width as a scroll bar, but always visible - not a flop-out.  When you move into that column, the cursor changes to something appropriate like an outlined triangle.  RedBug will then toggle a solid triangle, indicating that the corresponding entry is "marked".  If you draw through several rows, they all get marked the same as the first one.  YellowBug brings up a menu of items such as "move all," "print all," "forward all," etc.  This is somewhat remeniscent of the Neptune interface.This is, of course, almost identical in "semantics" from font changes in the list such as strike-out, bold, etc, except that there is a spatial factoring which makes visual scanning easier, and which admits of independent response to mouse clicks.One could imagine extensions to multiple columns for different properties - this has a bit the flavor of Laurel's optional user-supplied marks - but it's easy for this to get out of hand.*start*00421 00024 US Date:  4 Oct 83 11:56 PDTFrom: Yonke.paSubject: PA distribution list creation requestTo: Registrar.PAcc: Yonke.PAI am:Your name:		Martin D.

Surely if there is a crash during that process, the mail file should still be interpretable (e.g. by scanning forward from the last good message to a distinguished header for the next good one).Another glitch:  When my Vmem ran out, I was able to ^D from raid  back to the exec, but I was unable to logout from there.

We don't have any support for the notion of copying from one place in a file to another in the same file without an intermediate buffer.Lafite can easily compute (or estimate) the size of scratch file it needs, and go to DSK if the estimate is too large.  Or, more generally useful, the CORE device could recognize the LENGTH parameter (which it wants to take cognizance of anyway when you fix that device), and pass the open off to DSK if it exceeds a threshold.The problem you had with ^D is that extending the vmem file is triggered off of \NEWPAGE noticing that the new page was allocated sufficiently near the end of the vmemfile.  If you ^D at that point, the new page is allocated, but the caller of \NEWPAGE doesn't know that, so it calls again for the same page.  I think that interface can be changed to make that less of a problem.	Bill*start*00386 00024 US Date:  7 Oct 83 18:00 PDTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Lafite: MOVETO psTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Kaplan.paLafite-System-Date: 29-SEP-83 15:17:12Lisp-System-Date:  6-OCT-83 15:33:17Machine-Type: DoradoIt looks like the message that was written on top of others was the last message in the file.

I queried these when I first started using Lafite and was told that they were obscure but inherited from Laurel/Hardy and that I would soon come to know and love them. Two months of Lafiteing later, I know (some of them) but I love them not.Lafite seems to move when you hit the display button BEFORE it does anything iff that message is already currently displayed (even if the selection has been moved since the display, so the user has forgotten that that message is up) (sometimes causing a "No more messages" error, if that message happens to be at the end of the file) (leading the user to say. "What the..!!"). On the other hand, Lafite moves to the next message AFTER doing something, if that something is delete. UNLESS the next message has been deleted, which for some reason stops the movement on Deletion but not for Display (which happily shows the Deleted message). UnDelete, for some reason, doesn't advance (no reason why it should, but no reason why Delete should either, and it does.)As if that isn't bad enough, the rules are TOTALLY DIFFERENT if you have multiple messages selected (which you may not even realize if all but one of them are off the screen and you accidentally used the wrong mouse button). In that case, the movement is WITHIN the message set rather than to some "next" message for Display and none at all for Delete. I am almost convinced that there is also some interaction with whether or not this message or the next one has been examined yet (which is in turn related, in some flag controllable way, to whether or not I sent it). I say "almost convinced" because I ran out of unexamined messages before I could confirm my hypothesis.The point is that this set of rules is so byzantine that it is unrememberable (I had to check all these while I was typing the message) and, for me at least, they rarely do the right thing.I understand that common usage patterns have to be easy (and that leads to some non-uniformity), but could we please have a simpler semantics? I'll resist the urge to design one, but for example, having the "next" message be uniformly defined (like, after the last message selected, no matter how many) would help. So also would being able to control it (like by having message advance only invoked if the command is selected with the middle mouse button).Even if (because noone else agrees with me or, out of sensitivity to the legions of Laurel users) none of the present wierdness can be changed, can we have at least the following:a) It is bizarre that there seems to be no way to delete a message without seeing the one that happens to follow it. It makes pruning a large mail file ridiculously slow and makes it very difficult to skim thru junk mail by header.b) Since the behavior of Lafite changes drastically when there are multiple messages selected, could the selection button be a different shape so that one could at least TELL that this might happen?Beau*start*00932 00024 US Date:  8 Oct 83 22:55 PDTFrom: sheil.paSubject: Re: GripesIn-reply-to: Yonke.pa's message of  9 Aug 83 15:54 PDTTo: Yonke.paA long while ago, I mentioned that I was getting a lot of page faults while running Lafite and asked"Is there some very non local data structure associated with the msg file?"to which you replied"Yes, it's your mail file on Phylum."I meant, of course, that there might be some data structure that you were using on the local machine to index the message file that might be (a) large and (b) accessed essentially at random, which was diluting the working set.I now believe that most of what I was seeing earlier was TEdit structures, and John Sybalsky worked some on cleaning those up.However, I am still noticing a lot of swapping when I scroll my mail browser, so it might be worth considering whether the Lafite internal structures could be compacted any.Beau *start*00525 00024 US Date:  9 Oct 83 17:02 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: lafite compacting mail foldersIn-reply-to: MASINTER.PA's message of  8 OCT 83 03:10 PDTTo: MASINTER.PAcc: Yonke.PA, LispSupport.PA(a) Since you can't do compacting in place with SETFILEPTR, BIN and BOUT, you'd have to add some sort of special operation to handle what amounts to FILEBLT.(b) Creating a new version is an enormous loss for the "normal" case, viz. when you have only deleted a few messages near the end of the file.	Bill*start*00580 00024 US Date:  9 OCT 83 20:44 PDTFrom: KAPLAN.PASubject: Re: lafite compacting mail foldersTo:   vanMelle, MASINTERcc:   Yonke, LispSupportIn response to the message sent   9 Oct 83 17:02 PDT from vanMelle.paIf we had multiple streams on the same file, with appropriately shared buffers and some regime whereby the server didn't complain about conflicting read/write accesses (i.e. Lisp should inform the server that the file is opened BOTH, even tho there is one read-stream and a separate write-stream), then we could compact in place using COPYBYTES.*start*00742 00024 USaDate: Mon, 10 Oct 83 08:31 PDTFrom: Feuerman.PASASubject: Re: Display Stream vs. WindowsIn-reply-to: "Burton.pa's message of 7 Oct 83 17:06 PDT"To: Burton.pacc: Feuerman, LispSupport.paRichard,Thanks, the recompiling did it.Incidentally, I've tried using LAFITE from within Interlisp and have an interesting problem.

The current NS file servers do  not support random access and Lafite really believes in random access files.  This can be solved in a variety of way.  a) Wait for NS file servers to be random access (I believe this is scheduled for next summer).  b) Fake random access by cacheing the files as core files (and pray they don't get too big).  c) Convert Lafite to not believe in random access files (ugh!!!).Since I'm already up to my hips (maybe neck), its not high on my stack.

In the other case, I must decline responsibility for the characters once I've bksysbuf'd them.  That seems to be what is happening here.I'm now looking to see WHY TEdit didn't think the mail sender was a TEdit window.	--John*start*00551 00024 US Date: 14 Oct 83 14:41 PDTFrom: Sybalsky.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Assorted problems (TEdit side)In-reply-to: Stansbury.pa's message of 14 Oct 83 12:42 PDTTo: Stansbury.pacc: Sybalsky.pa, Yonke.pa, LispSupport.paThe problem is not that copying is interruptable, it's that your copy request resulted in TEdit BKSYSBUFing the characters.

For one thing, if the number of msg headers is more than can fit in the window, it still displays the first N msgs and THEN redisplays to the end. Any reason for doing this instead of just showing the last N which fit on the window. As it is, using Lafite on a Dolphin seems too slow compared to Laurel.*start*01234 00024 US Date: 14 OCT 83 21:11 PDTFrom: JONL.PASubject: Re: lafite compacting mail foldersTo:   vanMelle, MASINTERcc:   Yonke, LispSupport, JONLIn response to the message sent   9 Oct 83 17:02 PDT from vanMelle.paI'd like to see two capabilities re this problem:  1) some server machine whose job in life is to receive "batch" requests,     and run them at the appropriate time. (admittedly, this implies an     operator, to restart the server when it dies).  Then I could submit     a request to do (LAFITE.COMPACT.MAILFOLDER '{PHYLUM}<JONL>SOMEDL.MAIL)     and it would be run at, say, near 5AM when phylum isn't too busy.     Thus I could delete away at messages, and they would be so "marked",     but I would never call for compaction while I'm actually "here".  2) a similar server (perhaps the same one) that just builds table-of-contents     files for mail folders.  then an attempt to call LaFite on my 500-     message monster wouldn't take 30 minutes just to scan the 400 messages     that didn't come in today anway.  True, the TOC would be partialy out     of date, but scanning from msg#400 to msg# 500 should take only     1/5 as long as scanning the whole file (to update the TOC).*start*03138 00024 USaDate: 15 Oct 83 18:35 PDTFrom: BrianSmith.paSubject: Lafite Bugs and CommentsTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: BrianSmith.paFirst a bug:1. If you shape a browser window so as to move the upper boundary upwards, the contents are not automatically updated as they should be (in fact they seem to revert to the original size of the window).And a question:2. LafiteDisplayDeletedMessageFlg doesn't seem to exist (any more?).  Is this intentional?And finally some suggestions (do you want suggestions like of this sort? -- let me know if not.)3. The "date" column in the browser display seems to take the first six characters from the date field of the message, rather than extracting the date in any more sophisticated way.  Thus a message header that says "Mon, 10 Oct 83 17:05 PDT" will be abbreviated in the browser as "Mon, 1", rather than as "10 Oct".  I presume that there must be full date parsers in the system; could they be used here, so that all dates were in the "<date> <month>" format?4. When selecting messages in a mail folder, the middle button adds a message to the growing set of selections.  I have often wanted to be able to remove a message from a growing set of selections, primarily in order to recover from having pointed incorrectly.  Currently, if you make a mistake, you have to start all over again.  The middle button might "toggle" the membership of a message in the selection set, much in the way that Neptune File selection does.5. If you button "display" on a browser, and the currently selected message was the last one displayed from this browser, it advances the selection to the next one.  This seems correct, *if that last message is still in the display window*.  But, when browsing more than one mail folder at once (which I like doing!), I often go back and button "display" on a mail folder in order to see the selected message again, and am surprised when it advances to the next message.I would, therefore, rather have "display" advance to the next message *only if the currently selected message is actually in the display window*, not merely if it was the last one displayed from this folder.  Could this be done?Also, the automatically advancing pointer selects deleted messages; I think Laurel skips over deleted ones, which seems to me the right strategy.6. There is no way for the user to use the "mark" in the edit display ("m" for moved, "f" for forwarded, etc.), as you can in Laurel.  It would seem that lafite's use of this should still be able to be overridden, in the same way that it is in Laurel.  We talked about wild and wondrous extensions of this (with arbitrary predicates, and perhaps a list of "properties", like hardcopy, moved, etc., and the ability to select messages on the basis of a property).  However, as someone who used Laurel's ability to use these marks, I would be happy, for now, with the ability merely to type in a single character.  I think Laurel's interface is perfectly usable -- if you select right on top of the character, you can type a character, in which case that becomes the new mark (delete aborts).Brian*start*00446 00024 US Date: 15 Oct 83 18:37 PDTFrom: BrianSmith.paSubject: Another commentTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: BrianSmith.paTwice today I have accidentally typed "control-D" while composing a message, which seems to abort the message irrretrievably (once losing about two pages of work).

But there are really two problems (at least) involved.  (1) The way Lafite builds a "browser map" of what messages are where in the window is dumb and should be fixed -- this fixes the "it still displays the first N msgs and THEN redisplays to the end" problem.  (2) Laurel has the advantage that it only talks to your local disk and not through a network to a time-shared file server  -- which will slow you down some.

We must be scrupulous to avoid doing this, both for Xerox' legal liability (they tend to be sensitive about "copying" issues) and also to preserve Symbolics' willingness to provide Johan with LM software.Beau*start*00627 00024 US Date: 25 Oct 83 09:59 PDTFrom: Halasz.paSubject: Lafite: Lafite login after returning from logoutTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 19:52:21Machine-Type: DandelionLafite login after returning from logout no longer appears to occur asynchronously.  The laftie login window pops up and EVERYTHING waits until the lafite login is complete.  Seems like the lafite login used to (and ought to) occur asynchrounously with the return-from-logout processing so that you could go on and do other tasks before logging in to lafite. Frank  *start*00578 00024 US Date: 25 Oct 83 13:50 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Lafite login after returning from logoutIn-reply-to: Halasz.pa's message of 25 Oct 83 09:59 PDTTo: Halasz.pacc: Yonke.pa, LispSupport.paI suspect that what you are observing is that if there are remote files open over logout (e.g. your mail file), then on coming back from logout the system tries to reestablish the openness of those files, which requires getting your password.  It just so happens that Lafite asks for your password first, but that's a mere matter of timing.	Bill*start*00522 00024 USaDate: 25 Oct 83 13:54 PDTFrom: Martin.pasaSubject: Lafite: setting LafitexxxREGION variablesTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, Martin.pasaLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 19:52:21Machine-Type: DolphinAccording to the current documentation, if you set LAFITEBROWSERREGION, LAFITEDISPLAYREGION, or LAFITEEDITORREGION to NIL, the system will prompt you for a region with GETREGION. That did not work for me.  (SETQ LAFITEDISPLAYREGION NIL) returns NIL.Rick*start*01672 00024 US Date: 25 Oct 83 16:02 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: GETMESSAGEFIELDFROMFOLDER1To: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date: 24-OCT-83 18:56:52Machine-Type: DoradoI was looking at this function because of the FILEPOS glitch (see earlier message), and noticed that it was making an awful lot of calls on FILEPOS.  As I read it, it calls FILEPOS at least three times for each field.  For example, for a message that contains exactly one Subject: field, it calls FILEPOS once finding the actual field, then calls it a second time to make sure there isn't another instance of the field, then finally (because FIRSTTIME has not yet been set to NIL) calls it a third time looking for Subject with no preceding <cr>.Since Lafite seems (to me at least) to be spending an inordinate amount of time parsing message headers, I have several observations and questions:1) The extra FILEPOS I describe above is clearly a bug.2) Why do you search for and store, for EVERY message, fields that never appear in the Toc?  Specifically, SENDER, CC, and REPLY-TO, and usually TO, none of which is needed for anything except answering the message.3) GETMESSAGEFIELDSFROMFOLDER locks the mail folder, then calls GETMESSAGEFIELDFROMFOLDER, which also locks the mail folder, and does so for each field you want to extract.  That is a lot of work!  WITH.MONITOR is not, unfortunately, cheap, nor are the OPENMAILFOLDER/CLOSEMAILFOLDER you also call for each field.  Gack!4) Given all this, why don't you just parse each header exactly once, without ever using FILEPOS--just scan each line of the header?	Bill*start*00489 00024 USaDate: 25 Oct 83 18:35 PDTFrom: Sheil.paSubject: Lafite: Update while answer/forward in progressTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 19:52:21Machine-Type: DolphinIf you run Update while an answer or forward is in progress, and if the msg being answered or forwarded is deleted, the background message sender will break when trying to mark the message if the update happens to finish first.Beau*start*00532 00024 US Date: 26 Oct 83 11:37 PDTFrom: halvorsen.paSubject: Lafite: Menu overlapping with browserTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, halvorsen.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 19:52:21Machine-Type: DandelionIn the current>full.sysout I get the lafite menu on top of 1/4 of the browser when I do the following:Activate  MOVETO  and then,  after confirmation trying to select a new message while the file is busy and the message "moving messages to......." is being displayed.*start*01050 00024 US Date: 26 Oct 83 21:36 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: Failure to UpdateTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date: 25-OCT-83 20:42:21Machine-Type: DoradoI closed a browser, selecting "Update and Close".  The only thing I had done to the browser was move messages into it.  This is a case where Lafite (in its current awful toc mechanism) needs to write out a new toc, but does not need to touch the mail file.  Lafite apparently does neither in this case, which means it has to parse the whole damn file again the next time I browse it.  Arrrrgghhhhhh!A glance at UPDATECONTENTSFILE suggests that the problem is that you assume that if a toc file exists, it is correct; however, when you decide you need to parse a file, you fail to delete an old (by definition incorrect) toc file, and similarly you fail to delete it when you move messages into a mail file.  Indeed, if I manually delete the old toc file, Close and Update appears to do the right thing.	bill*start*00341 00024 US Date: 27 Oct 83 10:35 PDTFrom: Burton.paSubject: Lafite: reparsingTo: Yonke.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date: 20-OCT-83 14:00:51Please change the parsing routines to fix the case of the last message having to few characters.

A Tedit of this file shows that it is generally in the right format.  Seems that Lafite ought to recover much more gracefully from whatever little bug is causing this mail file not to parse.  With this particular file, recovery would be trivial if the problem spot were just skipped over.  At least Lafite could give an indication of where it thinks the error is instead of printing out a vitrtually meaningless msg like "cannnot parse."Frank*start*20437 00024 US Date: 30 Oct 83 17:01 PDTFrom: BrianSmith.paSubject: Trashed messageTo: LafiteSupportcc: BrianSmith.paI am appending a message that I found in my active mail file; it consists of a real message that should have been there, followed by a fragment of some other message (begins at the "sk provides ...

We may want to come back to Plotkin (or some other focused topic) at a later time, when we are more focused, and when there is someone who is prepared to take on the task of leading the Plotkin

Just the basic time parser is 2400lines of code.  It knows about all the time zones of the world thedifferent formats and many different languages.  Not surprisingly it isimplemented using a grammar and parser etc. etc.In general, I don't think Symbolics worrys much about us copying theircode.  They know that for purely technical reasons its nearly impossibleto translate Zeta-lisp to Interlisp-d.  The only thing you could do isstare at the code, understand it and then implement it in Interlisp-d.They don't care about this.
