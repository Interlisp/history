I agree that it would be convenient to have some way to to inform the thing that you're not a spastic and can make the correct selection from a menu, but would prefer that you didn't use RIGHT, since RIGHT is ordinarily reserved for the background or window menu.  Two alternative solutions:(a)  Since one's belief as to his spasticity is not likely to change very frequently, probably setting a variable would be a good enough way of telling Lafite what to do here.(b)  Using LEFT to select from a set of folders to move to means "I think I am about to spaz out; please let me verify my choice" and using MIDDLE means "don't ask me silly questions".

I am including MessageSystemImplementors^ in this summary because it may be of use to other people as well.The conventions we are following now are intended to minimize the amount of special knowledge that mail processing programs need to have about ARPA names.  In particular, it is never necessary to know where a particular copy of a message is going to go when generating or interpreting name fields.  The necessary name translations are made automatically when a message is forwarded by the Xerox-to-ARPA gateway (currently Maxc).  A lot of messy code got ripped out of Laurel and Hardy when we converted to the new conventions.You are correct that names in headers and in property lists obey somewhat different conventions.  More precisely, anything that is legal in a property list is legal in a header; the reverse is not true because some information may optionally be omitted from headers but not from property lists.In a property list, the correct form is always "simpleName.registry".  A Xerox name such as Dekleer.PA should be expressed in just that form; it is never appropriate to append "@PARC-MAXC".  An ARPA name such as Johan@MIT-MC.AG or Johan@MIT-MC.ARPA or Johan@MIT-MC.ARPA.AG has as its simple-name everything to the left of the rightmost period and as its registry the name on the extreme right.  (All three of these names are legal and mean the same thing.)We have two registries for the Xerox-to-ARPA gateway, ARPA and AG; this is mostly for convenience.  Fully-specified ARPA names have a syntax that is compatible with Grapevine names: they end with a period followed by a top-level domain name.  Currently the only top-level domain is ARPA.  So we have defined ARPA as a top-level registry in Grapevine as well.  The AG registry is for future use with non-ARPA domains or for situations in which a top-level domain has not been specified.For generating property lists from names in headers, the algorithm is very simple.  (This is the actual algorithm used in Laurel.)  If a name containing a "@" already ends in ".ARPA" or ".AG" then use it as it stands; otherwise append ".AG".  A name not containing a "@" is never changed.In a header, things are somewhat more complicated because of the defaulting that is permitted.  The basic rule in Xerox world is that a name that is not qualified by a registry is assumed to be sender-relative, i.e., to be in the same registry as the name in the Sender field (or the From field if Sender is absent).  The only exception is that a name containing a "@" is assumed to be in the AG registry.  The sender name must always be qualified by a registry.For example:    From: Taft.PA    To: Dekleer    cc: Johan@MIT-MC, Smith.ES"Dekleer" means Dekleer.PA because it is relative to the sender's registry (in the From field).  "Johan@MIT-MC" means Johan@MIT-MC.AG because it contains a "@" and does not end in ".ARPA".  "Smith.ES" means what it says, since it already has a registry and does not contain "@".It is no longer ever necessary to treat ".PA" or "@PARC-MAXC" specially, as this is handled property by the Xerox-to-ARPA mail gateway.  In particular, you do not need to append any additional registry or domain qualifications just because there is a recipient in a different registry or in ARPA.In case you are wondering what the Xerox-to-ARPA mail gateway does, here is what the above header would look like when it gets sent over the Arpanet:    From: Taft.PA@PARC-MAXC.ARPA    To: Dekleer.PA@PARC-MAXC.ARPA    cc: Johan@MIT-MC.ARPA, Smith.ES@PARC-MAXC.ARPANow suppose Johan@MIT-MC.ARPA sends a reply:    From: Johan@MIT-MC.ARPA    To: Taft.PA@PARC-MAXC.ARPA    cc: Dekleer.PA@PARC-MAXC.ARPA, Smith.ES@PARC-MAXC.ARPAThe ARPA-to-Xerox forwarding gateway will convert it to the following before forwarding it to Grapevine:    From: Johan@MIT-MC.ARPA    To: Taft.PA    cc: Dekleer.PA, Smith.ESIn order to fully appreciate what is going on here, it is important to understand that the Xerox and ARPA name spaces are mutually embedded.  When you stand in the Xerox name space, the entire ARPA name space appears within a single Xerox registry, AG (or ARPA).  But when you stand in the ARPA name space, the entire Xerox name space appears within a single ARPA domain, PARC-MAXC.ARPA.  It is the responsibility of the mail forwarding gateway to translate names between the two name spaces.All clear now?	Ed*start*00415 00024 US Date:  8 Nov 83 11:47 PDTFrom: Burton.paSubject: Lafite: "from Semillion - [abort] server fullTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date:  8-NOV-83 05:21:33Machine-Type: DoradoAbove message appeared while delivering a message.

Everyone knows that static type-checking is wonderful, right?  But Cedar has both static type-checking and a "runtime type system" so there must be something to the arguments for dynamically typed languages like Smalltalk or typeless languages like LISP.  Or, to quote Ron Newman:In current Star development, there is a surprisingly strong trend away from static checking and towards late binding;  we seem to have more and more procedures which take or return ATOMs or raw LONG POINTERS (what Cedar calls REF ANY's).   This trend concerns me.This topic should provoke some stimulating comparisons and discussions (I will try to keep them from having religious overtones).

Jackson, Jr., President, Office Products Division, has announced the realignment of OPD into an organizational structure featuring three Business Units.Each Business Unit (BU) will be headed by a Vice President and General Manager reporting directly to Jackson and be responsible, on a worldwide basis, for the planning, development and delivery of products under the control of the BU.  Each Business Unit will have direct reponsibility for all relations with international affiliates.The three BUs established immediately are:o	Electronic Typing BU -- John P. Lafferty, Vice President and General	Manager;o	Information Processing/Personal Computing BU -- Bruce V. Gitlin, Vice	President and General Manager;o	Telecopier BU -- Sidney N. Bass, Vice President and General Manager.Jackson said that each Business Unit will be staffed to provide planning, engineering, service support, program management and support for the launch of products through manufacturing and OPD's various marketing channels.Jackson also said OPD will continue to have an independent Manufacturing and Distribution organization; the BUs will draw upon advanced manufacturing resources so that they can impact the products early in their design cycle and ensure a smoother transition of products into manufacturing.*start*00461 00024 US Received: from RUTGERS.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA;  8 NOV 83 14:45:25 PSTDate: 8 Nov 83 17:44:51 ESTFrom: Jeffrey Shulman <SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA>Subject: Dandelion net bootTo: lispsupport.pacc: SHULMAN@RUTGERS.ARPA	What is needed (software-wise) do have net boot capability (vsfloppy) for the Dlion?

New version on <LISP>LIBRARY and [Maxc]<LISPUSERS> (shortly).  On this round of changes, this file now requires that exports are loaded before it is recompiled for Vax or D.In working on this, I discovered a fairly major shortcoming of the new EOL scheme (which I implemented in response to numerous requests):  If you LOADFROM a file on a host that has EOL convention CRLF, edit one function, and then MAKEFILE on a host that has a different EOL convention (e.g. CR), then what you get is a file that has a mixture of eol conventions.  The functions that got printed will have CR's, while the functions that got copied (by COPYBYTES) will have CRLF's.There are 2 ways out of this:1.  Have MAKEFILE in the reprint case notice that the EOL convention of the source is not the same as the eol convention of the destination.  In this case, instead of calling COPYBYTES, do a loop that does \OUTCHAR of  \INCHAR (\INCHAR is a new macro exported from LLREAD, that properly interprets the EOL convention of its stream).  This would be significantly slower, but presumably this is a rare case.  Perhaps we should define a machine-independent function COPYCHARS that does this.  (COPYCHARS would call COPYBYTES if the eol conventions are the same)2.  Have MAKEFILE specify that the EOL convention of the output file is always the same as the EOL convention of the source.  This will cause new functions to be printed in the same mode as the ones that are (quickly) copied.  This will work in a useful way only if a file can be marked individually and permanently with its eol convention when it differs from the default of the host it happens to be on.  I fixed the Core device to keep track of the EOL convention in a permanent way.  Is this possible for other hosts, like IFS, Tenex, Tops-20, etc?If not, and if there are no other proposals, I suppose we should revert to #1.  *start*00917 00024 US Date:  8 Nov 83 18:21 PDTFrom: Stansbury.paSubject: Re: Lisp: EOL conventions and SINGLEFILEINDEXIn-reply-to: Kaplan.pa's message of  8 Nov 83 17:29 PDTTo: Kaplan.pacc: Lispcore^Apropos of making MAKEFILE even slower (with COPYCHARS):I suggested some time ago (and I believe Steve Gadol suggested to me) that MAKEFILE not prettyprint but just print.  That ought to speed it up significantly.  And the drawbacks are all overcomeable:  (1)  You wouldn't be able to read a sourcefile very well.  But then one presumably should use LISTFILES, and LISTFILES could do the prettyprinting.(2)  PF* wouldn't work, but then since it takes some time anyway, it might as well do the prettyprinting itself.In short: one MAKEFILEs considerably more frequently than one LISTFILES, and it seems that the tricky, time-consuming stuff ought to be done by the less frequent operation.-- Tayloe.*start*00542 00024 US Date:  9 Nov 83 09:26 PDTFrom: dmrussell.paSubject: Lafite: Magic areas of the screenTo: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, dmrussell.paLafite-System-Date: 20 Sep 83 13:21 PDTLisp-System-Date: 23-SEP-83 00:11:11While typing in a msg in Lafite, a section of the screen suddenly became /terra incognito/.

Two points:(1)  Could you be a bit more specific than 'Couldn't complete' ?(2)  The error message printed in the second line of the temporary window, and was then immediately covered by the Display-Delete-... menu.  Shortly thereafter the temporary window, along with its obscured message, disappeared altogether.  It took me a couple of tries to figure out that the message was being printed at all.  A solution, it seems, would be to (a) position the temporary window completely above the menu so that you could see both the menu and the entire contents of the temp window, and (b) not close the temp window if it contains an error message -- at least keep it open until you make another selection from the menu (thus indicating that you've actually been looking at that part of the screen).-- Tayloe.*start*00415 00024 US Date:  9 Nov 83 17:03 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: alternative formsTo: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 12-OCT-83 15:12:48Lisp-System-Date:  4-NOV-83 11:24:23Machine-Type: DoradoHow about renaming "Clean Form" to be "Standard Form" and "Another Form" to be simply "Other"?

Clarification:   -- When moving a message, if a mail folder is selected with the       right button from the folder menu, could we avoid being asked       for confirmation?   --  I believe this is what the middle button will let you do.The middle button, when used on the "move to" selection at the head of the browser window, moves without confirmation to the default "move to" file.  But if you use the left button, and get to select from the whole menu of potential folders, no matter what button you then use to select from that menu, you are asked for left button confirmation.  My request was for middle or right on that full menu to not require confirmation.Also, since I keep over 50 active mail folders, when I use the left button I get an enormous list of file labels.  It would be nice to have a way of shift-selecting the file label out of the message itself (again, this was possible in Laurel).  So, for example, if you selected the "move-to" entry with shift-left-button, it might ask you for a mail folder label (kind of the way "another folder" does), and you could shift select it from the message header.  It would be nice if such an entry could be terminated with escape, rather than requiring carriage-return, since the former can be done with the left hand while the right hand remains on the mouse (this would hold for the "another folder" request as well).  Probably confirmation should not be required in such a case, since you get to see the name before hitting the confirming character.For the "suggestions" box.By the way, with respect to multiple copies of an address in an answer: the following message header:---------------Subject: Re: DECIn-reply-to: Ray Perrault <RPERRAULT@SRI-AI.ARPA>'s message of Wed, 9 Nov 83 15:50:58 PSTTo: RPERRAULT@SRI-AIcc: csli-computing@SRI-AI, rperrault@SRI-AI, kjb@SRI-AI---------------was created by buttoning "answer" to a message with the following header:---------------Received: from SRI-AI.ARPA by PARC-MAXC.ARPA;  9 NOV 83 15:49:25 PSTDate: Wed, 9 Nov 83 15:50:58 PSTFrom: Ray Perrault <RPERRAULT@SRI-AI.ARPA>Subject: DECTo: csli-computing@SRI-AI.ARPAcc: rperrault@SRI-AI.ARPA, kjb@SRI-AI.ARPA---------------So if it is a question of different spelling, capitalization must count (or is it because of the < ... > construction?).  *start*00364 00024 US Date: 13 Nov 83 16:27 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: skipping deleted messagesTo: Yonke.paLafite-System-Date: 13-NOV-83 00:53:25Lisp-System-Date: 13-NOV-83 01:11:39Machine-Type: DoradoThis new version of Lafite is still failing to skip over deleted messages when it advances the selection following a display or delete.	Bill*start*00298 00024 USaDate: 13 Nov 83 16:42 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: timezoneTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 13-NOV-83 00:53:25Lisp-System-Date: 13-NOV-83 01:11:39Machine-Type: DoradoLafite is still sending messages whose Date says PDT instead of PST.*start*00964 00024 US Date: 13 Nov 83 17:35 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: another broken mail fileTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite-System-Date: 13-NOV-83 00:53:25Lisp-System-Date: 13-NOV-83 01:11:39Machine-Type: DoradoI attempted to browse a file and got a "couldn't parse".

Lafite does HardCopy as follows: it creates a text stream, then for each selected message, it prints the "Message n from x" header on the stream, does a TEDIT.INCLUDE of the appropriate stretch of the mail file, then prints the message separator (formfeed or line of dashes, according to LAFITENEWPAGEFLG).  When it's all done, it does a TEDIT.DELETE of the final separator (kludge).The bug arises in that last TEDIT.DELETE, which deletes from the value of GETFILEPTR after the last TEDIT.INCLUDE to the end of file.  In the current system, that GETFILEPTR happens to be BEFORE the last inclusion, rather than after it (as the code apparently expects).  Disregarding for the moment the hokiness of the above algorithm, have you changed something?  Is outside code allowed to depend on where the file ptr is after a TEDIT.INCLUDE?  Probably, since you're allowed to print things directly to text streams.	Bill*start*00502 00024 US Date: 14 Nov 83 15:32 PDTFrom: dmrussell.paSubject: Lafite: It says it sent it...To: Yonke.pacc: LispSupport.pa, dmrussell.paLafite-System-Date: 20 Sep 83 13:21 PDTLisp-System-Date: 23-SEP-83 00:11:11... but it didn't.If you fill in the To: field incorrectly (viz. don't leave a space between the To: and the addressee ...

But I agree it needs fixing.  My current objections:It repeatedly tells me I have new mail, even though it is not very interesting to know that I still have new mail 5 minutes later.  i.e., the time part of the "you have new mail" message is irrelevant for grapevine, and probably is not reflective of anything for Maxc, either, although it could be (the info coming back from Maxc includes the time of last mail).  This is one of the reasons the window keeps coming to the top.The window is bigger than it needs to be.  A large part of the excess is the Quit command, which seems silly.  Is there any need for a quit command over and above the normal Close command on each Lafite window?  If not, then let Close do everything.  In particular, you should be able to close the Lafite headline window without affecting the other window and without losing any functionality (implies putting something on the background menu, perhaps, for "Lafite status window").	Bill*start*00669 00024 US Date: 20 Nov 83 17:27 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Few bugs/commentsIn-reply-to: Yonke.pa's message of 11 Nov 83 17:23 PDTTo: Yonke.pacc: vanMelle.paHmm.  I think that's an exceptional case.  The expectation when a file is in the menu is that it's an old file.  The main reason for the confirm is in case your finger slipped when you selected the filename.  I would recommend that if you select a mailfile name from the menu, that you prompt for confirmation WITHOUT saying [old file]/[new file].  Then, if the file turns out to be nonexistent, come back and say something like "Foo.mail does not exist.  Confirm creating it."	Bill*start*00654 00024 US Date: 20 Nov 83 17:50 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: SendMail in background menu failsIn-reply-to: Kaplan.pa's message of 13 Nov 83 22:40 PDTTo: Kaplan.pacc: LafiteSupport.paThis is because the mail from background menu is leaving out the step of converting a mail form description into something Tedit likes.

I'm curious as to why no one has answered my original question about the use of "In-response-to" rather than "In-Reply-To".  Is Walnut the offender?  Is there a chance it might get fixed?2.  Re:  "I thought we all agreed on the benefits of a machine-readable		envelope and an uninterpreted message body."	By no stretch of the imagination is the header part of a Grapevine message "uninterpreted" as far as mail user interface programs are concerned.  If that were true, for example, then mail programs would generate replies by using only the information in the "envelope".  Currently this is not possible.	I would actually be in favor of a rich enough set of Grapevine item types to be used for machine consumption, thus allowing the message body to be truly uninterpreted.  In the mean time, Fillet puts most manipulation of the message header in the mail program's domain.3.  Re:  "...use the postmark provided by Grapevine when you		retrieve the message."	If Grapevine postmarks are to be used for identifying reply chains, then "in-reply-to" information (mentioning the appropriate postmark) must be associated with reply letters, either in the "machine-readable envelope" (i.e. a new "in-reply-to" Grapevine item) or in the message header (i.e. something like "In-Reply-To: <64#74@2615854453>".  Note that including "message-ID" information in the message header is actually unnecessary (but perhaps convenient).  Either way, a new convention is required.4.  Re:  "(Unfortunately, Grapevine omits to tell you the ID		when you send the message, though)."	Indeed this is unfortunate, although it could be fixed with a small addition to the Grapevine protocol.  The solution to this problem that we have chosen for Fillet is to generate a separate unique ID (item type 1041B, structure same as a postmark) when sending messages.  If anyone else starts sending postmarks or IDs around to identify messages, it would be useful if they used the same convention as Fillet:  use the unique ID if it is present, othewise use the Grapevine postmark.5.  The convention of generating "In-reply-to: Your message of ..." rather than "In-reply-to: Putz's message of ..." (when "Your" is supposedly unambiguous) is unfortunate.  Users have the habit of editing the "To" field so that the "Your" reference becomes incorrect.  This makes it impossible for a program to find the message being referenced.  It can also be confusing to human users.  [Note that the message to which this is a reply is just such an example.]*start*01189 00024 US Date: Wed, 23 Nov 83 09:06 PSTFrom: Taft.PASubject: Re: "In-response-to" vs. "In-Reply-To"In-reply-to: "Putz's message of Tue, 22 Nov 83 21:35:16 PST"To: FilletSupportcc: Birrell, MessageSystemImplementors^1. I don't know anything about "In-response-to". It's possible that it was mistakenly added by the human sender.2-4. I think Andrew is wrong about this. We have to distinguish between envelope-ID and content-ID. The Grapevine "postmark" is an envelope-ID, which is used strictly for transport purposes (e.g., duplicate elimination and tracing). The RFC822 Message-ID is a content-ID, which is associated with the message independent of how or whether it is being transported.Since in the ARPA world the only structured portion of a message is the header, that is the logical place to put the content-ID. In the Grapevine world, where we have multi-segment messages, putting the content-ID in a separate segment, as proposed by Steve, makes a lot more sense.5. The variant of In-reply-to in which the field-body is a phrase as opposed to a message-ID has no defined semantics. Any attempt to interpret it mechanically is probably misguided.	Ed*start*00269 00024 US Date: 23 Nov 83 12:50 PDTFrom: halvorsen.paSubject: Lafite: Shift select out of meesage display window doesn't workTo: LafiteSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 15-NOV-83 15:53:11Lisp-System-Date: 21-NOV-83 19:54:28Machine-Type: DandelionKris*start*00491 00024 US Date: 23 Nov 83 20:05 PDTFrom: Kaplan.paSubject: Lafite: Subject in Answer messagesTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Kaplan.paLafite-System-Date: 13-NOV-83 00:53:25Lisp-System-Date: 16-NOV-83 13:21:42Machine-Type: DoradoIf you bug Answer to answer a message that had no Subject line, the template comes up withSubject:  Re: NIL.I think in that case that the subject line should be omitted, or else something more meaningful consed up, like "Reply to Jones"--Ron*start*00800 00024 US Date: 27 Nov 83 16:05 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Lafite: LAFITEUSEHIGHESTVERSIONFLGTo: LafiteSupport.paLafite-System-Date: 15-NOV-83 15:53:11Lisp-System-Date: 17-NOV-83 18:59:02Machine-Type: DoradoGets very confused.  If you browse FOO.MAIL;2 and then do a MoveTo FOO from another browser, the first MoveTo works, but the next one (with middle button to accelerate) moves into a new file FOO.MAIL;1, and there are then two FOO's in the mail folder menu.  Also, somewhere in there you get a File Busy inside LA.LONGFILENAME, which seems to be the culprit--it returns a filename with version 1 if it fails to open the highest version.
