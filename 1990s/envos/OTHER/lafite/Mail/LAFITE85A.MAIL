A little poking around showed that the Browse operation had been initiated under the now-OLDMOUSE process, and had subsequently hung-up due to the IFS's catatonia.  This kind of catatonia is occurring with more regularity recently, perhaps because there are more and more personal Dorados banging around on the two critical file servers.Perhaps one background process could be established to "pick up the ball" whenever some Lafite operation is initiated by the Mouse, such that the time required of the MOUSE process can be kept boundedly low.-- JonL --*start*01018 00024 US Date:  3 Jan 85 17:58 PSTFrom: Halasz.paSubject: Lafite: Mail files on Vax-Unix not handled correctlyTo: LafiteSupport.pa, TEditSupport.pacc: Halasz.paLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 20-Dec-84 12:24:52Machine: Dorado (Halasz)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 10000Frequency: AlwaysImpact: SeriousLafite will not handle mail files stored on the PARC-CSLI Vax.  If you open a browser on a file and do a GetMail, you will get a correct browser.  But the mail will be unreadable because the carriage returns are all messed up.  There are black squares where there should be carriage returns.  If you BIN thru the textstream in the mail window, you'll find that the black squares are actually LineFeed characters.  Someone is forgetting to translate the Unix LF characters into the InterLisp CarriageReturn character.If you just TEdit the whole mail file, the carriage returns are correct implying that TEdit does the correct character conversions.Frank*start*00573 00024 US Date:  4 Jan 85 16:54:20 PSTFrom: Murray.paSubject: Re: Odd behavior from Semillon.msIn-reply-to: "vanMelle's message of 31 Dec 84 18:15 PST"To: vanMelleCc: GVSupport^Reply-to: Murray.paThanks for the info.Things were probably confused. I'm not exactly sure what/why, but some critical process was probably (semi)hung on a monitor lock. I say semi because it later recovered enough to give you a msg (via Ernestine).

I really need tools to help me manage it. I will build same, if I can get hooks which will make my tools compatible with Lafite, and reliable (I don't want my own version, nor do I want flakey mail reading). Hooks needed (I think):1) A call when mail is read: at the very end of GetMail operation, call a user function with the folder and the list of message numbers just added.2) A function to produce a (handle on) the message number N in a folder F.3a) A function to produce the contents of field S of message M (or, if its any easier, field S of message number N of folder F); presumably this would be a string.3b) If Lafite contains code for producing more meaningful information about certain fields (dates, lists of addressees), then  the user-level version of those fields would be nice to have too.4) A function to move message number N from folder F1 to folder F2.5) A function to mark message N of folder F with character C. (Actually, it would be nice if the marking on a message in a folder could be extended to be a list of characters, or even better atoms. Then multiple marking would be possible. But this has impact on the Lafite user interface, so don't get these other requests backed up behind this one.)At the moment, I am 900 messages behind. Having these tools sooner rather than later would really help me out. When might I expect something like this to be available? I'd be a willing victim to try it out (for which purposes, I'll relax my above-mentioned criterion of "utterly reliable").Thanks,Austin*start*21641 00024 US Date:  7 Jan 85 17:42 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Programmer's level interface to LafiteIn-reply-to: AHenderson.pa's message of 7 Jan 85 13:08 PSTTo: AHenderson.pacc: vanMelle.paFormat: TEditI assume you are willing to deal with a completely unpolished interface, so I'll tell you what the current truth is about the Lafite on <LispCore>Library> and in the latest <LispCore>Next>Full.sysout.  What follows might be viewed as the start of an implementor's manual.  It is not, of course, anything I'd be willing to publish as a programmer's manual, but perhaps your experience will help us define what one might wish the interface really to be.  I'm quite willing to add small things as you see the need, though there is little hope for any major projects in the near term.  So let me know how this matches your needs.My other reluctance, of course, is that internals, as these all are, are subject to change without notice, so I'd appreciate feedback on what parts you would like to see solidified into a supported interface.There are almost no direct functional interfaces to what you want, but with some record definitions I think you can get most of it.  You thus need to LOADCOMP(LAFITE).  In general, you should probably avoid replacing record fields, as there are usually interactions; if you need to replace a field for which there is no programmatic interface, let me know.  Fetching fields should be fine.  The important records are two datatypes, MAILFOLDER and LAFITEMSG. MAILFOLDER holds assorted facts and state about a single mail folder.  The window property MAILFOLDER hangs off each Lafite browser window.  Here are the most interesting fields:FULLFOLDERNAME, VERSIONLESSFOLDERNAME, SHORTFOLDERNAME -- various forms of the folder's name.FOLDERSTREAM -- a stream on the file behind the folder, if it's open. MESSAGEDESCRIPTORS -- an array of LAFITEMSG objects, corresponding to messages 1 thru #OFMESSAGES.  Thus (ELT (fetch (MAILFOLDER MESSAGEDESCRIPTORS) of folder) n) returns the nth LAFITEMSG in folder.  This field is only valid while a browser is open on the folder.FOLDERLOCK -- a monitor lock that should be acquired if you want to perform any operations on the folder.FIRSTSELECTEDMESSAGE, LASTSELECTEDMESSAGE -- number of the first and last messages currently selected (equal if only one selected).BROWSERWINDOW, BROWSERMENU, BROWSERMENUWINDOW, BROWSERPROMPTWINDOW -- pointers to parts of the browser window for this folder.  NIL if no browser open on folder.(\LAFITE.GETMAILFOLDER folderName) -- this function returns a MAILFOLDER object for folderName, which should be either a full file name or a full name sans version number.  If the result has a non-NIL BROWSERWINDOW field, there is a browser currently open on the folder, else not.(\LAFITE.OPEN.FOLDER folder access recog) -- returns a stream on the file behind folder.  access and recog are as with OPENSTREAM.  This is the standard way to get the stream (rather than the FOLDERSTREAM field), unless you're sure the file's open for the right access.Each message in a browser is described by a LAFITEMSG record.  Its most interesting fields:PARSED? -- true if message has been parsed.  Set by LAFITE.PARSE.MESSAGE.FOR.TOC, which also distributes the standard parse into the fields FROM, SUBJECT, DATE.DELETED? -- true if message is marked deleted.SEEN? -- true if message is marked seen (NIL => "?" in browser).MARKCHAR -- character code of message's mark.MARKSCHANGED? -- true if MARKCHAR has changed since last update.SELECTED? -- true if message is currently selected.MSGFROMMEP -- true if message is from the logged in user.# -- ordinal position of message in folder, from 1.BEGIN -- byte position in file of start of message, which is always the internal header that starts "*start*".MESSAGELENGTH -- length of message, including internal header.STAMPLENGTH -- number of bytes between the BEGIN position and actual start of message.START -- access field: byte position of the start of the actual message, viz., BEGIN+STAMPLENGTH.END -- access field: byte position of the end of the message, viz., BEGIN+MESSAGELENGTH.DATE -- date of message, actually just the 6 character string that appears in toc (so you can't give it to IDATE).FROM, SUBJECT, TO -- From, Subject, To fields of the message.  The TO field is usually only parsed out if MSGFROMMEP has been observed to be true.Now, how to use all these:The value of the variable LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN, if non-NIL, is a function to call immediately after Lafite retrieves mail from a server.  It is called with two arguments, the MAILFOLDER, and a list of LAFITEMSG objects describing the new messages (which have already been appended to MAILFOLDER:MESSAGEDESCRIPTORS, securely stored in the file, but not yet displayed in the browser window).  The messages have not yet been parsed, I believe.  The function is called while in control of MAILFOLDER's monitorlock.Parsing messages.  The function LAFITE.PARSE.MESSAGE.FOR.TOC sets all the fields in a LAFITEMSG that the toc needs, but you probably want more fields than that, so will need to do your own parsing.  Lafite has a simple-minded but reasonably efficient parser that looks for header fields in a message (Field name followed by colon) and does something with them.  It requires that you build a "parse table" describing what you want it to do.  This is a list of lists, one for each field you want to parse.  Each sublist is in the form ("FieldString" ResultFn . ResultArgs).  Then "compile" the parse table by calling (LAFITE.MAKE.PARSE.TABLE table).  The resulting compiled table can then be passed to this function:(LAFITE.PARSE.HEADER stream parseTable start end onceOnly) -- Stream is the stream where the message lives -- the folder's stream for message in a file, or a tedit stream for a message you're sending.  parseTable is the compiled parse table.  Start and End are byte pointers in stream (normally the START and END fields of a LAFITEMSG).  Parsing automatically stops at the end of the header.  onceOnly is true if you want parsing to end as soon as any one field has been successfully parsed.The parse proceeds as follows: the parser starts at byte position start and scans each line in the header, seeing if the field name matches (case-insensitively) a field in the parse table.  If a match is found (the characters match up thru the colon), then the parser skips over any white space, then calls the ResultFn indicated in the parse table with two arguments, the stream (now positioned at the first non-blank character after the colon) and the ResultArgs from the table (this lets you multiplex one parsing function for several purposes).  The function's job is to parse the rest of the field, leaving the stream positioned after the terminating <eol>, and to set freely the variable PARSERESULT as it wishes.  PARSERESULT is what LAFITE.PARSE.HEADER ultimately returns.You may not need to follow that too closely.  Lafite's standard use of the parser is to make PARSERESULT an alist; the following functions are interesting as resultFn's, or to help them.  You can look at the variable LA.FULLPARSEFIELDS and LA.TOCFIELDS for examples.  The former is used for a "full parse", such as the Answer command needs; the latter parse three fields out for the toc.(LAFITE.READ.TO.EOL stream) -- Reads the rest of the field, returning one long string.  You should probably use this as the basis for all result fns, as it takes care of continuation lines and makes sure the stream is left properly at the end of the field.(LAFITE.READ.LINE.FOR.TOC stream Args) -- Reads the field as one big string and stashes it on PARSERESULT indexed by (CAR Args).  If all of your resultFn's are this one, then your parse result ends up something like  ((field1 "contents1")(field2 "contents2")...).  The string is limited in length to 255 characters (a toc restriction); if longer, it is truncated.(LAFITE.READ.NAME.FIELD stream Args) -- This is almost the same, but no string length restriction, and it recognizes that some fields may have multiple occurrences (bad form, but allowable).  If a field occurs twice, its alist entry has more than one string in its cdr: ((field1 "contents1a" "contents1b") ...).(\GV.PARSERECIPIENTS field registry internalFlg editWindow) -- This function takes raw strings from the output of LAFITE.PARSE.HEADER and produces a list of individual recipient names.  Field is a string or list of strings, such as LAFITE.READ.NAME.FIELD might produce during the header parse.  registry is the grapevine registry default for names without registries (defaults to DEFAULTREGISTRY).  If internalFlg is true, the names returned are in internal form (name . reg); if NIL, the names are strings of the form "name.reg".  editWindow is for error messages (true when sending mail).(LA.SETDIFFERENCE x y) -- like LDIFFERENCE, but treats x and y specifically as sets of strings, case-insensitively.(LA.REMOVEDUPLICATES x) -- removes duplicates from x, treating x as a set of strings, case-insensitively.Message manipulation.  Most of these update the browser window appropriately.(SELECTMESSAGE msgDescriptor mailFolder) -- "selects" msgDescriptor, a LAFITEMSG object, in mailFolder.  Does not deselect anything.(UNSELECTALLMESSAGES mailFolder) -- unselects all messages.(MARKMESSAGE msgDescriptor mailFolder mark) -- changes msgDescriptor's mark character to mark (a charcode).(SEENMESSAGE msgDescriptor mailFolder) -- mark msgDescriptor "seen".(DELETEMESSAGE msgDescriptor mailFolder) -- mark msgDescriptor "deleted".(UNDELETEMESSAGE msgDescriptor mailFolder) -- undelete msgDescriptor.Most of the browser commands consist of a function \LAFITE.nameOfCommand, some of which spawn processes named \LAFITE.nameOfCommand.PROC.  Here's the one for MoveTo:(\LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC window mailFolder destinationFolder item menu shortOutput oldFileP) -- moves all selected messages from mailFolder to destinationFolder.  Greys out item of menu while it's working (the BROWSERMENU field of mailFolder gets you the menu).  When finished, if exactly one message was moved, and it was the one currently displayed, does the "display after delete" action.  shortOutput is the folder's name (in short form, but it really doesn't matter).  oldFileP is true if the caller believes, but has not yet verified, that destinationFolder describes an existing folder (this is true if the folder was on the folder menu).  window is mailFolder's BROWSERWINDOW.As I said, "unpolished".  You probably really want the not yet defined subfunction of that: (\LAFITE.MOVE.MESSAGES mailFolder msgDescriptors destinationFolder).Let me know if you have more questions, as I'm sure you

arrived at yesterday's meeting, we discussed the issues of letter bombs.  There was a consensus, I believe, that the potential for foul play does, however remotely, exist, and furthermore, that the appropriate solution is some implementation of registered objects in TEdit.  We also agreed that, especially in light of the strong concerns in Pasadena, Lafite could not be released so long as this problem remained.We now face the following dilemma: modifying TEdit for Harmony at this late date is a strain for you and others, but if we release TEdit as it stands, then, in the future, this version will potentially be in the field, leaving some users (who uses Lafite with this version of TEdit) vunerable to the Soviets.The following solution has been proposed:  if, in your estimation, the changes to TEdit would be fairly easy, and particularly if they do not require modification to existing documentation, we'd really like to get the changes into Harmony.  If this is not the case, then when we release Lafite, it will be made to check for a new version of TEdit, which has the registration.  Under any circumstances, then, it is most important that the changes to TEdit be made by the time Lafite goes out.Would you please estimate what level of effort is involved in fixing the problem, and let me know whether you think it is feasible to get the changes into Harmony?Thanks,Paul      *start*00490 00024 US Date:  9 Jan 85 16:15 PSTFrom: monty.paSubject: Lafite: IDIFFERENCE brokenTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: monty.paLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 20-Dec-84 12:24:52Machine: Dandelion (25200047576)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 13777Frequency: OnceImpact: MinorWho knows what happened.

NSHardy is now in the hands of Nannette Gainey of the Mesa group, who is currently developing the 11.1 and 12.0 versions of the tool.  All problems relating to NSHardy should now be submitted to the Mesa group in the form of ARs.Updated:-- The NSMailSendTool now does backward compatability for old-style (Grapevine) DLs.  In other words, if it finds an UpArrow, it'll run through the "If Need Reply-To" code as if the name were a Clearinghouse Group.  This was provided for users of the Grapevine/NS Mail Gateway.-- Disallows the moving of messages with attachments between mail files so as to avoid accidental expunges of attachments by users who don't read/remember the documentation.-- Asks for confirmation before deleting attachments during an expunge.As before, the files are stored on [Iris]<ServicesTools>8.0>Tools>, Doc>, DF>, Source>NSHardy>, and Source>DistSvc>.

Rather than have everyone reporting this same bug until Intermezzo comes out, it is suggested that it be moved to the Harmony directory, and included in the Harmony Full.sysout.The problem with this idea is that we will lose track of what is in the Harmony release and what is not.  A year ago, we put "the release" on the directories <lisp>sources> and <lisp>library>, and people updated these directories as bugs were fixed.However, this organization meant that we had no handle on what versions of the files belonged in which release.  This made it difficult to interpret bugs from the field, since we couldn't easily look at the code they were running.As part of the effort to get the Interlisp release process more organized, the <lisp> directory was split up into seperate subdirectories for the different releases: {eris}<lisp>Carol>, {eris}<lisp>Harmony>, etc.  Once the release goes out, these directories should not be altered.  These directories are our record of what is in the release.In order that our internal users will not have to wait until the Intermezzo release to get bug fixes (like our external customers do), I suggest that we start putting improved versions of Lafite, Tedit, etc. on the directory {eris}<Lisp>Intermezzo>, and advertise the existance of the "next release" directory.  People who are happy with the Harmony release can continue using it, without worrying that packages will change from under them -- people who explicitly want some bug fixed can get the improved version.Actually, Lafite is something of a special case.  Since it is not being released to the customers with Harmony, there is less need to "freeze" the version on <lisp>Harmony>.  However, I feel that the Tedit on <lisp>Harmony> should NOT be changed.*start*06353 00024 USaDate: 17 Jan 85 13:10 PSTFrom: AHenderson.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Programmer's level interface to LafiteIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 7 Jan 85 17:42 PSTTo: vanMelle.pacc: Burton.pa, AHenderson.paBill:I have looked at your description of the Lafite implementation, and do indeed have a few (actually 19 as it turns out) questions:1. Does \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC spawn a process. If so, does the move happen only after the LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN is completed? (I  am assuming idthat if it is a separate process it has to wait for the Getmail Process to release the monitor lock.) But then, suppose I want to move a message to two different folders, how to "undelete" it between the moves? Also, how do I insure that the order of the moves is correct. I suppose I could simply record the moves to be made until I have looked at all the mail, then do all for one folder, wait till they get moved, then do all for the next undeleting the deleted ones, etc. Thoughts?2. If LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN is called before the browser is updated (you say so, and that is consistent with your other comment that the messages are not parsed at the time of the call), what happens when I call a function like MARKMESSAGE, SELECTMESSAGE, etc as part of my LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN which you say has an effect on the browser and presumably assumes that the browser is updated? Maybe we should make a change so that the LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN is doing stuff just as a user would after the mail has come in: the user can't get in before the browser is updated, so neither would the user's function. This would have the effect that the user would see all the actions that his function was taking on his behalf. This would slow things down, but might in the end be best - he could see when things were going wrong and change his function (or specs if the function is an interpreter for some mail.handling language).3. Will \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC move a deleted message?4. I love your parseTable compiler etc. But is there a way of requesting that the function be called on every field of the message. I expect I may need that. 5. (related to 4) Is "compiling" a parseTable fast? That is, is it something that I might consider doing each time I go looking for a particular message field?6. I'll probably cache the results of analyzing message fields, at least over the processing of a single message in case many rules make queries on the same field. FROM, SUBJECT, TO and DATE are already cached as part of the message descriptor. Is there some extension of that mechanism which I should use? If I wanted to save it longer, are there any hooks within LAFITE that let me add it to something that lasts longer (I am thinking about something like adding arbitrary PROPS to a message descriptor - that is, a LAFITEMSG object). Would that put it into the TOC file too?7. Speaking of TOC files, you don't describe what is in them and how they are interact with the mechanisms you do describe. Is there anything I should know?8. (Academic question) Is it a bad idea, or is it OK, to hold references to message descriptors beyond the LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN function? In particular, if the folder is updated, and messages get renumbered, does the # field get changed in place? How about those that get deleted: can I tell that it is obsolete (NB: not that it is marked for deletion)?9. (Academic question) Same question for the list of messagedescriptors which is the value of the MESSAGEDESCRIPTORS field of the MAILFOLDER object? If the lsit changes (update, getmail) will this list become obsolete, or change in place, or ... ? Admittedly, neither of these actions can happen during the LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN with the fucntions you've told me about, but I'm curous.10. Is PARSERESULT global, or bound in the context. Actually the question is should I declare PARSERESULT in the function using it to be global or just use it freely?11. Is there a function that will get a MAILFOLDER from a simple name (eg. ACTIVE)? Or alternatively, is there a function that will produce the folderName argument for \LAFITE.GETMAILFOLDER ("either a full file name of a full name sans version number") from a simple name? I want to be sure that I get to the same place that LAFTIE would without having to know all the relevant variables and the algorithm for producing that name.12. Will \LAFITE.GETMAILFOLDER produce a folder for a file which does not exist yet (possibly with a request for confirmation)? I'd like it to, so that a rule could say move anything which matches P to folder F and have folder F spring into existence when I ask for it en route to handing it as destinationFolder to \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC.13. Does \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC expect its folders (particularly its destinationFolder) to be open already?14. Do I ever need to close a folder? If so, is there a function to do so?15. Neither \LAFITE.GETMAILFOLDER or \LAFITE.OPEN.FOLDER opens a browser on the folder does it?16. (Academic question) Is there a function which opens a browser on a folder (with possible interaction with the user)?17. Does the processing done by the LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN simply added to that done by Lafite anyway? If so, then will Lafite do some processing after the LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN, possibly clobbering what that function did (eg. marking them differently - space if FROMME)? If not, then is the LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN responsible for carrying out certain actions which Lafite does not now do because there is that function? Again, it feels to me as though the change which would give the user control at the very last moment before the GetMail is completed would be best.18. (A detail) What are LA.SETDIFFERENCE and LA.REMOVEDUPLICATES used for? That is, what are the arguments to these functions? I think I've missed the point here.19. (A detail) The name \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC does not follow the pattern that you suggest for the browser command functions: shouldn't it be \LAFITE.MOVETO and the process it spawns (but see question 1) named \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC? Is this a typo, my mis-reading, or is this the exception that proves the rule?That's all for now. I really appreciate your help. I'm going to have a go at getting my mail sorted using whatever I can hack. I'll keep you informed. All the best,Austin*start*09911 00024 US Date: 17 Jan 85 14:28 PSTFrom: Blomberg.paSubject: Lafite: Break Window when Retrieving MailTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Blomberg.paFormat: TEditLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date:  3-Jan-85 16:59:08Machine: Dolphin (JBlomberg)Microcode version: 24,1Memory size: 6000Frequency: AlwaysImpact: FatalYesterday had several problems with my mail and someone helped me.

vanMelle.pa, Burton.pa1.  \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC does not spawn a process--it is the function that the process spawned by \LAFITE.MOVETO calls.  Thus, your calls (if all from the same process, of course) will be in complete synchrony.  No need to undelete messages if you want to move a message twice, since \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC is quite willing to move a deleted message (as is the user interface, for that matter).I still think a subfunction LAFITE.MOVE.MESSAGE would be a helpful thing for me to define.2.  On closer examination, I see that the messages do get parsed and the browser updated before LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN is called.  I also see a parenthesis error that means the fn is only getting called on the messages retrieved from the first server with new mail; must fix.3.  See 1.4.  Do you mean you want to parse out fields of the header where you don't know ahead of time what the field name is?  Doesn't sound terribly useful, since how would you know how to interpret the field?  I seem to recall thinking about extending the parser in that way for something, though.5.  The parsetable compiler is not especially fast, since it is only intended to be called once.  But I don't know what you would consider acceptable speed.  I suspect you might want to cache parsetables if you really want to choose your parse table on the fly.6.  There is no provision for adding arbitrary props to a LAFITEMSG, there being so far no other users of it than Lafite.  I could add such a field, or you could use a hashtable to maintain addition props.  No, they would have no hope of getting into the toc file.  The format of the toc file is deliberately not general; it is designed to be compact, efficient to load and update.7.  Well, roughly speaking the toc contains everything that you see in the browser window.  The only interaction with other things is that when you change something in the browser window, you have to make sure the toc knows about it so that it knows to update the toc file when you update the browser.  The updating functions (MARKMESSAGE, DELETEMESSAGE, etc) already take care of this, so I don't think you have to worry about anything unless you plan on changing any of those LAFITEMSG fields directly.8.  The Answer and Forward commands have the same problem--they are holding on to one or more LAFITEMSGs, and want to mark the messages with an "a" or "f" after the message is successfully delivered.  The test they use is something like (AND (SETQ MESSAGES mailFolder:MESSAGEDESCRIPTORS) (EQ msg (NTHMESSAGE MESSAGES (fetch (LAFITEMSG #) of msg)))).  In other words, is the browser still open on this folder, this LAFITEMSG still in the folder, and its number correct.  [Further note: NTHMESSAGE is a macro to access MESSAGEDESCRIPTORS; it currently macros to ELT.  I doubt it will change, but it's slightly cleaner if you use NTHMESSAGE instead of ELT.]9.  No, you can't hold on to the MESSAGEDESCRIPTORS field.  It's an array, and arrays can't grow in place.10.  PARSERESULT is bound in the parser.11.  (LA.LONGFILENAME filename ext) -- fills in defaults for filename.  Ext is the default extension; other defaults are taken from LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&DIR.  For example, the routine that prompts for a mail folder calls (LA.LONGFILENAME (U-CASE filename) LAFITEMAIL.EXT).12.  \LAFITE.GETMAILFOLDER assumes you have done all the worrying about whether the file exists.  Higher level routines under Browse and MoveTo are the ones that ask for confirmation if a file doesn't exist yet.  In particular, I believe that if you call \LAFITE.GETMAILFOLDER on a file that does not yet exist, then call \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC with that as destination, that the file will be created (as long as the OLDFILEP arg is NIL).13.  No, \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC does not require its folder args to be open already.14.  There is a function (\LAFITE.CLOSE.FOLDER folder reallyP).  If reallyP is NIL, this does a FORCEOUTPUT; if T, it really closes the file.  You probably never have a need to call this yourself, except possibly if you want to do a FORCEOUTPUT on all your moveTo destinations when you're thru, which seems like a good idea.  Both this function and \LAFITE.OPEN.FOLDER require that the caller hold the folder lock.15, 16.  No, \LAFITE.GETMAILFOLDER and \LAFITE.OPEN.FOLDER do not open browsers.  Opening a browser is a two-step process.  First, you open a browser by calling (\LAFITE.PREPARE.BROWSER foldername), which returns a mailFolder.  Then you load the folder into the browser by calling (LAB.LOADFOLDER mailFolder), while holding the lock for mailFolder.17.  See 2.  All that happens after your LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN runs is that the browser is scrolled (if necessary) to expose the first new message (this should probably be changed to expose the first selected message, which could be different if LAFITE.AFTER.GETMAIL.FN made selections), and a tune is played on a DLion if you have set LAFITEGETMAILTUNE.18.  Not sure why I mentioned LA.SETDIFFERENCE and LA.REMOVEDUPLICATES.  They are used in such things as Answer when it is making up a recipient list and wants to avoid duplications; you might have no use for them.  There are other case-insensitive string comparison routines you might find useful, since you will surely want to compare recipient names case-insensitively.  You might want to use a macro I defined on LAFITE: (UCASE.STREQUAL X Y) returns true if X and Y are equal disregarding case.19.  See 1.  I should have been more specific about the role of \LAFITE.MOVETO.PROC in implementing the MoveTo command.Good luck.	Bill*start*00569 00024 US Date: 18 Jan 85 12:18 PSTFrom: Halvorsen.paSubject: Lafite: BROWSERREADY with newly created browserTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Halvorsen.paLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 10-Jan-85 13:28:55Machine: Dandelion (25200006547)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 17777Frequency: OnceImpact: ModerateBill,It seems as if BROWSERREADY is not set T after a newly created (emtpy) mail browser is brought up.

I got tha address parser working fine, have the predicate part of the mechanism working fine, and am about to start in on the action part. That will produce rules. Then I'll build rulesets.One thing though. If no message has been displayed, the FOLDERSTREAM of the FOLDER is NIL. How can I force Lafite to create on and fill that field in, so that I and it agree on the stream. I notice that although the stream gets filled in when a message reading is opened, when I manually close it, the field remains in tact. So the two (field filled in & message reading window open) seem to be independent. Shrinking and expanding (or maybe it is the updating which is part of shrinking?) seems also to loose the FOLDERSTREAM field.Thanks alot,Austin*start*01137 00024 US Date: 25 Jan 85 14:43 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Can't Read BitmapsIn-reply-to: ingalls.wbst's message of 23 Jan 85 16:51 ESTTo: ingalls.wbstcc: Sybalsky.pa, Denber.wbst, Turner.wbst, LafiteSupport.paThere was a change made in Harmony Lafite to make it send formatted messages in a different manner, by sending the "text" and the "formatting" separately.  This way, random mail readers (eg. Laurel) that don't understand Tedit format get just the text, without a lot of garbage.  Of course, older versions of Lafite (such as in Carol) also don't know about the new format of messages, so they constitute another class of "random mail reader".So far, so good.  Unfortunately, Tedit treats the body of Image Objects, in particular bitmaps, as part of the "text", rather than as part of the "formatting".  Thus, if you send a bitmap to a random mail reader, or pre-Harmony Lafite, said reader will see garbage where the bitmap should be.The fact that you retrieved the message with Carol Lafite is the critical element, since it didn't recognize the formatting part and threw it out.	Bill*start*00608 00024 US Date: 25 Jan 85 17:18 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: FOLDERSTREAM = NILIn-reply-to: AHenderson.pa's message of 25 Jan 85 10:08 PSTTo: AHenderson.pacc: vanMelle.pa, Burton.paDo you have a need to hold onto the stream independently?  The recommended way of accessing the stream is via the functions \LAFITE.OPEN.FOLDER and \LAFITE.CLOSE.FOLDER.  They are reasonably quick in the cases where the stream is already in the desired state.  And as long as you still hold the folder lock, nothing will happen to invalidate the stream that \LAFITE.OPEN.FOLDER returns.	Bill*start*01986 00024 US Date: 25 Jan 85 17:35 PSTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: Re: New Lafite usersIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 25 Jan 85 17:09 PSTTo: vanMelle.pacc: Raim.pasa, LafiteSupport.pa, Mersfelder.pasaFormat: TEdit1.  What do you mean by "access to LafiteSupport@Xerox"?Rather than discussing Laite issues via 1100Support@Xerox, they would like to know the mail address of the Lafite developers, which would circumvent 1100Support.2.  I was unaware that any customers yet had Lafite at all, much less were fixing bugs in it.Sloan School is a University Grant site.  As such, it has access to Xerox proprietary information, including our NS protocols (though OSD is still debating whether to give them pre-release documentation to NS Mail.)  Tom Moran signed a non-disclosure source agreement with XSIS.  He is not running Lafite; he is examining the sources in order to begin design for an intelligent mail filter.  During the course of this examination, his software team uncovered some bugs and raised some questions.  I advised them to use 1100Support@Xerox.3.  In fact, the NS version of Lafite is still considered Xerox proprietary; why would any customer have its sources?As mentioned earlier, Sloan School is not a customer, it's a Xerox Grant Site.  They have access to practically all XDE software, Star, and Interlisp.  They were awarded their grant on the premise they would substantially enhance Xerox product software.  Tom got the grant award based on his propsed extensions to our mail service.  4.

I can imagine some confusion people might have about deleting folders; I chose the word "Forget" as the best thing I could think of to mean "remove this folder from the menu" and NOT say anything about deletion.  Do you have any other thoughts on same?Yes, expunging a folder's contents and then closing the browser causes the folder to be forgotten.  This is presumably the right thing to do, since this action also deletes the file.  The only possible exception is that if you expunge your ACTIVE.MAIL folder, it probably shouldn't be removed from the menu, since you're likely to want it again.As for the "extra" confirmation when you type in a new folder name after selecting the "Other Folder" item in the folder menu, that confirmation is to say, "Yes, I really did mean this folder name, even though it doesn't exist".  The normal expectation is that the folder already exists; if you happened to mistype the name of the folder, this confirmation prompt gives you a chance to say "oops" easily, rather than having the bogus folder name created, which you would then have to close when you realized your error and try again.As for your final nitpick, it is a general design principle of "submenus" that they should include as one of their choices the item in the supermenu.  E.g., if you middle-button Browse, then decide what you really wanted to do was just plain Browse, you can select "Browse" out of the submenu, instead of having to click outside the menu to get rid of it and then left-button the original "Browse".	Bill*start*01128 00024 US Date: 27 Jan 85 17:00 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: NS Mail Server not respondingIn-reply-to: TBigham.es's message of 27 Jan 85 16:18 PSTTo: TBigham.escc: LafiteSupport.pa, Briggs.paYour problem is that your Network Support people (apparently) registered the server "MSSeneca:El Segundo:Xerox" with an address that contains an explicit socket number: 164#0.125000.16527#21.

Lafite tries much harder not to send malformed headers (in particular, the case you mention of not having a properly empty line after the header), and it sends its formatting info as a separate gv item.  Of course, new versions of software take a while to percolate to all users, so there are still a number of people using old buggier versions.If you continue to see bogus headers flowing thru, feel free to call them to the attention of LafiteSupport (assuming you believe Lafite the culprit).

The problem is that if Phylum is exceedingly slow, by the time Phylum tells Lafite "yes, I have stored all that mail" (before Lafite even tries to parse it), Grapevine has said "bye, you're too slow", so Lafite can't tell Grapevine it's okay to flush all the mail it just retrieved.  The alternative to getting the mail twice would be to have Lafite delete all the mail it just retrieved and try again later; I think most people would prefer to see their mail immediately, even if it arrives again later.  Perhaps it could warn you that this is the case, to reduce confusion.  Or maybe do something tricky, such as quietly try retrieving the mail again and discarding it if it is an exact duplicate.	Bill*start*01377 00024 US Date: 29 Jan 85 11:53 PSTFrom: AHenderson.paSubject: Lafite: Needed: "Display previous" and "display this one"To: LafiteSupport.pacc: AHenderson.paLafite System Date:  5-Jan-85 16:05:46Lisp System Date: 27-Jan-85 14:42:35Machine: Dorado (AHenderson)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 10000Frequency: AlwaysImpact: AnnoyingWith my mail selector working, I often find myself with a collection of widely spaced messages selected.

I am having several problems:1. When I have lots of messages (around 50 or more), I usually get a break with the message "not at end of message".2. If the NS mail server is not responding, the whole system hangs.3. The first attempt at LOGIN won't accept a space in the domain field, ie: "OSBU North" .  When the login window appears after a login failure, I have to backspace over the name and reenter it.4. If you type (LAFITTE 'NS) without loggin in with an NS name first, the system will hang until you hit the stop key.5. If I am in NS mode, and I want to send a Grapevine user mail, the domain gets attached  onto the end of the recipeints names when delivering.I am in room 2128 (ext. 4377) if you could contact me there instead of sending me mail, I would appreciate it.

This is a bad idea because it overloads the DEFAULTFONT entry in the FONTPROFILE.  You cannot change your TEdit default font without also changing your PP font and your DEdit font.  Bad news if you ask me.I suggest that we add an entry to the standard font profile called TEDITFONT that can be set in the same way as any other font class.  TEdit could then query the font profile (or the globalvar TEDITFONT) as necessary.Actually, for consistency we also ought to add LAFITE fonts to the standard font profile in the same way.

Generally, it has a notion about the "least" thing it can do to the folder.  If there are any changes at all to the folder, it thinks you can either update or expunge.  If there are no changes since the last update, but some messages are deleted, then it offers to expunge.

It started sounding familiar, like it could be the cause of some of these problems.

On top of that, they don't tell you (the sender) that they can't process your message, but just bounce it back to the Postmaster at the previous site. If that Postmaster doesn't know you (or me, or...) he doesn't take the time to manually send the rejection message back to somebody who cares enough to do something. Hence a lot of your mail has fallen into a black hole.The Unix sites on the Arpanet that forward a lot of mail (DECWRL, UCB-VAX...) have fixed this bug. That's part of the reason it took so long for me to learn about it. It's quite likely that a lot of the UUCP sites a hop or two away from the Arpanet will never get around to fixing this problem.About a week ago, I patched the Arpa mail gateway to change spaces to underbars (_) on the way out and invert that transformation on the way back in. Thus we don't need to quote your names anymore, at least in the normal cases. (If your name has an underbar, your Arpanet friends won't be able to send you mail directly. They will have to use an alias.)Actually, I've only managed to get half the change in. The headers of messages don't get the corresponding change yet. I also don't fixup the ""s correctly either.

There are two cases of simultaneity:1) Machine A has browser AND file open, but is idle long enough for Leaf timeout to occur.  Machine B opens browser/file, thereby breaking A's Leaf connection.  Machine B is happy; A will get an error next time it tries to use the file in any way, possibly resulting in consternation, because that particular error is poorly handled.2) Machine A has browser open, but file is closed (because A did an update or a shrink).  Machine B opens browser/file, gets new mail.  No problem because no contention (only one machine is trying to have file open).  However, Machine A does not notice that the file changed.  Thus, if A tries to write the file (get mail and/or expunge), assorted bad things can happen, the most likely being to produce "toc inconsistent with browser" and/or unparsable mail file, the worst being loss of all the new mail retrieved by B (if A does an expunge without a get mail).Given how disastrous (2) can be, it is high on my list of things to fix in Lafite.

The 6 messages it found either have no Subject, or have a Subject containing the string "NIL" (cute bug, yes?).  Find Related should definitely complain in this case, rather than give you this random selection of messages.As for your other case, I have no good explanation, but I'd be interested in knowing which messages were selected at the time you issued the command.  Find Related always keys off the last selected message in the case you have more than one.And by all means, if you have any repeatable cases, please show me.

The Fillet address checker did not previously catch "missing comma" errors of the form:	To: address1 address2 address3or	To: address1		address2		address3Since it either parsed the spaces as part of a single address ("address1 address2 address3", or stopped after the end of the first valid address containing an "@".  The first case is fixed by a check for illegal spaces.  The second case is fixed by a check for unread characters.2.  The address checker no longer allows empty addresses, e.g.	To: address1, , address2or	To: address1, (comment), address2Because it was not convenient, this error condition is still not detected within the group syntax, e.g.	To: a group: address1, , address2;3.  The address checker now reports syntax errors found within a private DL file.  To refresh your memory, private DLs are invoked using the group syntax with an empty address list, e.g.	To: MyList.dl: ;or	To: "[Filene]<Putz>MyList.dl":;The contents of the file should use the group syntax.  Remember that the trailing ";" is a required part of the group syntax.*start*00521 00024 US Date: 12 Feb 85 15:11 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: <Hacks>11.0> _ NSHardy, NSHardy2In-reply-to: AlHall.osbunorth's message of 5 Feb 85 19:58:23 PST (Tuesday)To: AlHall.osbunorthcc: vanMelle.paYou say "NSHardy now cooperates with the Interactive Terminal Service".

This bought us somewhat more efficient code in that we could use Inbasket.Locate to find the first new message rather than checking all messages to see if they are non-text (neither tText nor tEmpty).In cooperating with ITS, however, we can no longer assume this.  We must go instead with the assumption that most users (in our community) will be using a combination of NSHardy and Star such that in the short term there will not be much mail left on the server.  This means that the difference in efficiency is insignificant enough to warrant checking the attributes of all the messages in the mailbox.The code also takes advantage of the fact that ITS will mark a text message as received, but will never mark a non-text one as received.  The result is that messages are retrieved by NSHardy, starting with the first message in the mailbox, unless:	  envelope.inbasket.status = received AND NOT	  (attributes.bodyType = NSAssignedTypes.tEmpty OR	  attributes.bodyType = NSAssignedTypes.tText)Does this answer your question ?		-- Al*start*00463 00024 USaDate: 13 Feb 85 13:08:19 PSTFrom: Willie-Sue.paSubject: GV ItemTypesTo: Murray, vanMelle, Putz, SwinehartCc: Willie-SuePlease look at [Indigo]<Grapevine>ItemRegistry.txt, a (plain-text) file of the known ItemTypes.

Note that the Mail Gateway sends back an entirely new text message which refers to and also contains the text of the original message.If you want to return the contents of the original message, the only useful and non-harmful way to do so is by encapsulating the client items in a special "ReturnedItem" type.Hopefully Grapevine does this right and sends back a failure notification without sending a hybrid of the original and notification messages.If I have not convinced you to make this general change, then I at least request that all of the item types set aside for Smalltalk (1040B..1057B) not be returned in notification messages.-- SteveP.S.

I just got sidetracked with a handful of other things.There are 2 problems here. 1) What should the mail gateway and/or GV do when returning things, and 2) Should we document that in the item list that Willie-Sue is updating (for Cedar 6)?I don't yet know what GV does. I haven't taken the time to find that chunk of code.The Arpa mail gateway skips over item types 1013B, 1040B, 1041B and 1060B whenever it sends a message. This includes Arpa-GV messages as well as rejection messages. It also includes things like mail to Murray.PA.ARPA or Murray.PA@Xerox.ARPA. I sometimes use hacks like that for testing.-------I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. Your suggestion of only returning item types that it 'knows" about is one possibility. On the other hand, it seems reasonable to send back as much as possible since the user is likely to just fixup the header and retransmit. If, for example, there was a hunk of voice mail in a rejected message, it would seem handy to me to get it back too.An alternative is to add 2 new item types: one for text that should get inserted in front of the message (the Return-Path info) and another that is the text of the rejection message (so you could easily tell that it was a rejection message). This gets exciting since it will probably break Laurel.*start*02755 00024 US Date: Tue, 26 Feb 85 17:56:11 PSTFrom: Putz.paSubject: Re: Returning GV ItemsIn-Reply-To: "Murray's message of Sat, 23 Feb 85 20:36:39 PST"To: Murraycc: Willie-Sue, vanMelle, Swinehart, RobsonHal,I agree there are two issues.  I am most interested in what the Arpa gateway should do when returning messages.Thank you for your example of the voice mail.  It does fall into a different category than items like postmarks and tioga formatting.  The pictures which can be sent with Fillet messages also fall into that category.  I actually see a research issue lurking here (more on that below).It seems like you are trying to provide for mail interface features which do not currently exist while causing problems for features that do exist.  Although it might be desirable to return self-contained information like voice mail, I argue that in general Grapevine items are more dependent on other items in the same message, especially the text item.You said that the gateway skips over item types 1013B, 1040B, 1041B and 1060B when it returns a message.  But it obviously also provides new items of type 10B (Postmark), 20B (Sender), 30B (Return name), 40B (Recipients), and 1010B (Text).  Otherwise the return message would be confused with the original.If the goal is to return the contents of the original message, it seems important to return all of the items, especially the original Grapevine postmark or letter ID.  It also seems reasonable to return the exact original text and formatting items.Obviously the only way to return the original postmark and text items is to encode or encapsulate them as different item types.  This suggests that there should be a general convention for encapsulating forwarded or returned messages.  I would like to add such a feature to Fillet anyway for routine forwarding of messages.This appears to be an interesting research topic.  I am interested in defining item type(s) for this purpose and defining the format (it should be as simple as encapsulating entire grapevine items).In the meantime, I strongly believe that the mail gateway should make no decisions regarding grapevine items it does not understand.  The general case seems to be that client specific items depend on the existence and contents of other items.  This being true, it is unreasonable to forward or return such items unencapsulated.Since any item types defined in the future are likely to have this property, I suggest that the rule be that the gateway "skip over" all items it knows nothing about.I also request that all of the Smalltalk item types be so treated (1040B through 1057B).If anyone is interested in discussing th representation of forwarded messages, let me know.-- Steve*start*00609 00024 US Date: 14 Feb 85 18:50 PSTFrom: Bird.pasaSubject: Lafite: Automatic Folder ForgetTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Bird.pasaLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 10-Jan-85 13:28:55Machine: Dandelion (25200047503)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 5777Frequency: AlwaysImpact: MinorSuppose I have a folder in which all the messages are now marked for deletion.If I close+expunge the folder is not forgotten.If I update+expunge and then close, the folder *is* forgotten.This is mildly confusing.

Please give it a close technical review, correcting inaccurate information and supplying missing information.   Particularly, is there any information that should be included on modifying the program?   Comments on the literary style are welcome but not essential.   I like comments written on hard copy, but you can edit the file if you want.  The Lafite user documentation I've been writing will become part of an "important library packages user's manual," which I hope to have ready for Jazz.    Lafite Find, Mail Scavenger, and any other Lafite-related Lisp library and Lisp user packages will also be described even if they're not integrated into Lafite (will they be by Jazz?).  The Lafite documentation you wrote is good reference documentation and will be edited and put into the current library packages reference manual for Intermezzo.  For Jazz, the information that is redundant with the user's manual will be edited out. The more technical stuff, like the descriptions of global variables, will be put either at the end of the user's documentation or in the current edition of the library packages reference manual.  Getting back to current affairs, do you think you can update the current Lafite documentation and review the Lafite Find documentation by Friday or earlier?(the beginning)Lafite FindLafite Find is a package that helps you search by sender, subject, or date for messages in your mail folders.   It searches only in the table of contents of the specified folder, not within the messages themselves.  Once Lafite Find is loaded, you can bring up the top-level Lafite Find menu by clicking on the black title bar of the browser window with the center mouse button.  Three commands are listed on this menu:  Find, Find Related, and Find Again. To specify the direction you want the program to search in and the number of messages you want it to search for, choose the Find command with the left mouse button.   This brings up a menu listing four options:  Find Next One, Find Next All, Find Previous One, and Find Previous All.  To search forward in your mail folder one message at a time, use the Next One command.  To search forward for all appropriate messages, use Next All.  The Previous One and Previous All commands search backward.Selecting any of these commands with the left mouse button brings up another menu, which enables you to specify the text string you want Lafite Find to search for.  This menu lists four options:  From, Subject, Body, and Related.  To search for messages by sender, click on From with the left mouse button.  In the prompt window, Lafite Find asks you to supply the appropriate name by printing "Find From string" followed by a colon.  Type the name of the sender after the colon and press the carriage return.  If Lafite Find locates a message or messages from that sender, it informs you of this fact in the prompt region and marks the message(s) with the selection pointer.  If it cannot find any messages from that sender, it tells you so in the prompt region.If you wish to search forward for more than one message but not for all the messages from that sender, go back to the top-level menu and select Find Again with the left mouse button.  Lafite Find will select the next message from that sender with the selection pointer and tell you what its number is in the prompt region.  You can use Find Again to search for messages from that person until you specify another text string.To search for messages by date, use the Body option (which can also be used to search for senders and subjects).  The Body option works in the same way as the From option, and you can use Find Again to search for more messages with that date.You can use four different commands to search for messages by subject. The Subject and Body options in the bottom-level menu enable you to type in words or phrases to search for in the same way as the From option.  The other two commands require you to specify the string to be searched for by selecting a message with that same subject.  They are especially useful after you have already found one message with that subject and wish to find additional ones.The first of these commands is the Related option available in the bottom-level menu.  To use the Related option, select the message whose subject you want to search for in the table of contents.  Then click on the Related command with the left mouse button.  Lafite Find marks related messages with the selection pointer and tells you in the prompt region how many it found.   If it cannot find any related messages, it prints "No related message found" in the prompt region.The second of these commands is the Find Related command available in the top-level Lafite Find menu (along with the Find and Find Again commands).  The Find Related command differs from the Related command in that it automatically searches forward and for all related messages.  You cannot use it to search backward or for only one message at a time. You can use the Find Again command to search for messages by subject if the subjects were specified with the Subject or Body option.  However, you cannot use Find Again to search for the subjects of messages that were specified with the Related or Find Related commands.(the end)P.S. A random comment about Lafite Find:  I wish you'd rename the From command to Sender, to grammatically parallel Subject and Body.  (I can't think of a noun to replace Related, though.)*start*00626 00024 USaDate: 18 Feb 85 17:48 PSTFrom: Lanning.paSubject: Lafite: Mail file left open on "Hardcopy Only"To: LafiteSupport.paLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 13-Feb-85 12:11:02Machine: Dorado (Curie)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 10000Frequency: Once so farImpact: MinorI have set the HardCopyBatch flag T.

If you want to send mail to people on BITNET, CSNet's PhoneNet, or Mailnet, you can use the syntax in the subject line. The mail gateway will fixup the headers and adjust the address in the envelope to use the official relay hosts.User@Host.BITNET => User%Host@WISCVM.ARPAUser@Host.CSNet => User%Host@CSNet-Relay.ARPAUser@Host.Mailnet => User%Host@MIT-MULTICS.ARPAMany CSNet sites are actually Arpanet hosts. Mail to them should use the obvious Arpa address. It might work if you use the CSNet format, but your message will take an extra bounce which slows it down and uses extra CPU cycles on a machine that already busy enough.There are bound to be some rough edges on things like this. If you notice any, please let us know. If nothing funny happens for a while, I'll probably add the reverse transformations for incomming mail.*start*05294 00024 US Date: 22 Feb 85 15:56 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: revised LAFITEFIND documentationTo: Grimblecc: vanMelle.paHere's my revision of what you sent me.  I assume you are planning to also do some formatting.- - - - -Lafite Search Package (LAFITEFIND)LAFITEFIND is a package that helps you search for particular messages in a mail folder.   The search is a simple string or keyword search that examines either specific header fields of a message (From, Subject) or the entire message.  You can look for either one message or all messages matching a requested pattern.Once LAFITEFIND is loaded, you can bring up a menu of search commands by clicking on the black title bar of a Lafite browser window with the center mouse button.  Three commands are listed on this menu:  Find, Find Related, and Find Again.   The Find command is the general search command; the other two are special cases.If you select the Find command in this first menu, you are prompted with two more menus to determine the direction and type of search.  The first of these menus lists four options:  Find Next One, Find Next All, Find Previous One, and Find Previous All.  To search forward in your mail folder one message at a time, use the Next One command.  To search forward for all appropriate messages, use Next All.  The Previous One and Previous All commands search backward.  The forward searches all search forward from the last selected message in the browser; the backward searches all search backward from the first selected message.Selecting any of these commands brings up another menu, prompting for the type of search.  This menu lists four options:  From, Subject, Body, and Related.  The From and Subject options mean you want to search for messages by the content of their From or Subject fields; a Body search examines the entire message; a Related search is a special kind of Subject search.  After you select the type of search (except for Related), you are prompted to type a string to search for.  The search is case-insensitive; e.g., "Fred" matches both "FRED" and "fred".For example, to search for the next message sent by user Jones, click "Find", then "Find Next One", then "From".  Lafite then prompts you in the prompt region with "Find From string:".  Type the name of the sender (Jones) and then press carriage return.  If Lafite finds a message matching the string you type, it selects the message and scrolls the browser, if necessary, to expose that message.  If it finds no such message, it tells you so in the prompt region.If you want to find ALL the messages from Jones, then follow the same procedure, but choose "Find Next All" instead of "Find Next One".  Lafite selects all the messages from Jones, and you can then cycle thru them with the Display command, delete them all, move them all to a different folder, etc.If the message found by a Find Next One or Find Previous One command is not the message you were looking for, or you want to locate the next such message, you can repeat the search by selecting the Find Again command in the initial (middle-button title bar) menu."Body" searches can be used to locate a message by arbitrary strings in the message itself, rather than just in its From or Subject fields.  For example, a Body search can locate messages that are addressed to (or cc'ed to) "Jones", that were sent in the month of "Feb", or that mention "sugar" in their content.  However, such searches are potentially much slower, since they have to search much more territory.A "Related" search is a special kind of "Subject" search.  It looks for messages whose subject is the same as the currently selected message, plus or minus the "Re: " that the Answer command adds to a subject.  The easiest way to perform a Related search is to use the "Find Related" command in the initial menu, which is equivalent to the sequence "Find", "Find Next All", "Related".  If you want to do a Related search backwards, the "Find Related" command has a subcommand "Find Related Backward", available by rolling out of the menu to the right.  "Find Related" is very useful for locating all the messages in an interchange where everyone used the Answer command to reply to the first (or subsequent) message.Fine Points:"Find Related" does not check that the messages it finds are really related to the selected message, merely that the subject matches the search string formed by taking the subject of the selected message and, if necessary, removing the initial "Re:".  Thus, this command may find too many messages.The string searches are substring searches, so you need not type the entire user name in a "From" search, just enough to uniquely identify the sender.The "From" search also looks at the "To" field of messages of messages sent by you.  Thus, roughly speaking, "From" searches look at the same names as you see in the browser window between the date and subject of each message.The "Find Next All" and "Find Previous All" commands start the search with the currently selected message, unlike the "Find Next One" and "Find Previous One" commands, which omit the currently selected message.

It turned out that Lafitemailwatch was waiting to obtain the "getpassword" monitorlock.  Looking the lock, it claimed that the EXEC process had it.  The EXEC process was sitting at the top level of repeatedlyevalqt and didn't look like it had hold of it.  I tried a HARDRESET and that didn't release the lock.  At this point there were no lafite processes running but the lafite watcher window was still up.  Bugging Close in it didn't have any affect.  LAFITE(ON) returned ON without opening any windows or starting any processes.  I couldn't think of anything else to do so I had Dana reload.I think the first mystery was how the "getpassword" lock got into its inconsistent state.

So far so good (although eventually I'd like it to tell me what file to look for for that function, either from a special database or barring that, from the whereis database).I then tried 3 things:1.  I hardcopied the message.  The resulting image was not correct--it looks like the lines and spacing around the box are defined in terms of screen point constants instead of DSPSCALE units.2.  I loaded GRAPHER.DCOM to get the getfunction in.  I expected that I would then be able to do something to get the image object fully expanded, but in fact there seems to be no way of getting that to happen.   This is a real non-feature.  I think the encapsulating image object ought to have a displayfn that checks to see whether FGETD of the  getfunction is true, and if so, remove the encapsulation.  Thus, having loaded the proper file, the user could get his image object properly displayed by bugging the redisplay command, or by scrolling.I tried a few other things, none of which worked:  I tried displaying another message, then displaying the one with the image object.  I closed and opened the browser, and displayed the message again.  Still, the image object didn't expand.3.  Well, I then decided to update the browser to delete some messages, close it, and go to an Intermezzo FULL that has grapher loaded to begin with.  I opened the browser there and displayed the message.  Guess what:  THE ENCAPSULATION, NOT THE GRAPH, APPEARED.  In other words, my active.mail file had been modified by the update so that the enapsulated image object was stuck back in the file.  There is now no way to see the image!Because of #3, I think that Intermezzo can't be released without this getting fixed.--Ron*start*00790 00024 US Date: 28 Feb 85 15:00 PSTFrom: Sybalsky.paSubject: Re: TEdit and Lafite: Non-features with undefined image objectsIn-reply-to: Kaplan.pa's message of 28 Feb 85 14:29 PSTTo: Kaplan.pacc: TEditSupport.pa, Lafitesupport.pa, Lispsupport.paNyet.  It is impossible to PUT an encapsulated IMAGEOBJ, since it has no PUTFN.  Hence, you're in an environment where IMAGEOBJGETFNS probably hasn't been set up right.  If your grapherobj code doesn't create its IMAGEFNS until the first time it's needed, you won't have registered the GETFN.Second:  Hitting a mouse button over the encapsulated object's image will cause it to try to set itself up right.  However, this, too, checks IMAGEOBJGETFNS.

I will fix that in grapher, so that the imagefns are created when the grapher is loaded.  I think that redisplaying should cause the thing to expand, in addition to a mouse click on it.

The monitorlock code is written so that nothing but a ^D from Raid at the right instant can keep it from doing the resetsave that ensures the lock gets released.  Unfortunately, the unwind code is not so bulletproof, so there are ways to lose, e.g., by typing a ^E at the wrong instant while the unwind code is doing its thing.As for how to get out of this state, if the lock claimed the EXEC owned it, you can explicitly call RELEASE.MONITORLOCK on it from the EXEC process to release it, I think.

The file is created, even if a right button is pushed.	This problem may not be of any importance, due to the fact that customers won't have pre-existing mail folders, but here it goes anyway. If a mail folder exists on the Browse list with a name other than the full {server}<directory>file name (such as Active instead of {eris}<james>active) when that folder is browsed another mail folder is created with the full name. Both names point to the same folder. Since I was using Gary's mail at the time, I didn't want to try forgetting one of the folders to see if it affected the other.	If you try to quit Lafite while sending mail, the SENDMESSAGE process will also try to quit.  If nothing has been entered on the message form yet, it quits.  If something has been entered, confirmation to quit is asked.  If confirmation is not given, SENDMESSAGE does not quit.With all the net difficulties I have not been able to do an AR query on this three problems. Please let me know if no ARs exist on these problems (as far as you know) and I will submit them.	One other thing, when Gary accidentally retrieved his NS mail in his GV mail folder, two copies of the NS messages appeared in the folder for each NS message. I haven't been able to replicate the problem, so I haven't included it in the list above.							Cheryl*start*00527 00024 US Date:  8 Mar 85 11:26 PSTFrom: Burwell.paSubject: Lafite: Suggestion: Make \GV.PARSERECIPIENTS recognize addresses of the form: externaldl: ;To: LafiteSupport.pacc: Burwell.paLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 10-Jan-85 13:28:55Machine: Dandelion (25200025767)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 15777Frequency:  Impact:  It is possible to receive a message that has a to field of the form: externalmailinglist: ; (where the ; is optional).

I suspect that (like TEdit) it's great if you have a dorado,but too much of a pig to be worth using otherwise.  I.e. my first impression is that Lafite should be scrapped in favor of something new.	I am personally a big fan of MM and would like to seesomething like that in terms of complexity and user interface.  Idefinitely wouldn't attempt arbitrary text selection (ala Lafite), butmight provide the facility to move an entire letter into TEdit whereone would have that option.	I doubt that a "remote MM" operating on a TOPS-20 MAIL.TXTwould be satisfactory.  Many mail files (such as mine) are just toobig to parse/transfer each time you want answer a letter.  I don'tthink that Lafite (even on a Dorado) is accaptable in this regard.	I'd consider getting your mail on a vax and using the mh mailhandler.  mh (if you have never used it) stores messages in individualfiles in a subdirectory (or set of subdirectories called folders) withboring names like 45 46 47.  It also maintains a file which caches analist mapping filenames into the headers of those messages.  In normaloperation, mhe (the emacs interface) compares the write dates ofthe folder and cache.  If the cache is newer, only the cache is read--much more tractable than reading the text of the mail.Then, mhe reads any new messages and adds them to the folder andupdates the cache file incrementally.  If the cache is out of date,it need rebuilding, of course.	I would propose duplicating the function of mhe.  One nicefeature is that you could do it incrementally; logging in and usingmh tools where you haven't built the remote ones yet.  I would favornever duplicating the cache rebuilder.  It would be MUCH more efficient to invoke the unix one remotely.	A bunch of the mhe stuff is documented in /usr/stanford/lib/emacs/maclib on your friendly rdisted vax.	Another reason for avoiding TOPS-20 is that you don't losethe meta bit!--ChristopherP.S.

Changed files are LAFITE, LAFITEBROWSE, LAFITEMAIL, LAFITESEND, MAILCLIENT.There are no major changes in this release, but mostly fixes to bugs, gross and small, observed in recent releases.  These include:* "Long" file names appearing in Folders menu and on icon labels.  The new Lafite again uses as small a name as possible.  I apologize for the aberration.  You can get rid of the duplicate names from your folders menu by using the "Forget Folder" command underneath middle-button Browse, or its new "Forget Folders" subcommand, which lets you forget more than one at a time.  In case you're concerned, "Forgetting" just removes a name from the menu (does not delete any file), and the duplicate names were never an actual problem, just a nuisance in the menu.* A related problem of long standing: no more confusion between files of the same name on different servers, where one was on your default dir and the other was on the same directory name but a different server.* Break under DELETEMENU when Lafite had trouble delivering the message on the first try.* Multiple LAFITEMAILWATCH processes (when you quit Lafite and call (LOGIN)).* Bug in retrieving very long (> 99999 chars) messages.* Image objects in saved forms.* Status messages when you have failed to load a mail protocol handler (NSMAIL or MAILCLIENT), or have loaded more than one and have not selected a mode, are now a tad more understandable.* If an error occurs while displaying a message, Lafite tries again a second time, this time displaying the message without any Tedit formatting.  A side effect of this change, at least in the current implementation, is that if Display is taking a long time due to TEdit running off to load fonts, a ^E will let you see the message unformatted without further delay.Finally, it has been suggested that I remind people of the hardcopy "batch" feature: setting LAFITEHARDCOPYBATCHFLG to T will cause the Hardcopy command to batch up all your hardcopy requests and send them to the printer at one time (when you bug Update), rather than dribbling them out in wasteful (and easily misfiled) one-page chunks.  See Lafite doc for details.	Bill*start*00714 00024 US Date: 12 Mar 85 03:38 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: MAKEXXXSUPPORTFORM fixedTo: TEditSupportcc: vanMelle.paThe newest Lafite also has MAKEXXXSUPPORTFORM fixed in the manner we discussed: it accepts ADDRESS either in the form of a single string, or as an a-list.  If you now go back to your once buggy version of MAKETEDITFORM, where it passes TEDITSUPPORT unchanged to MAKEXXXSUPPORTFORM, we can advertise that TEDITSUPPORT is in the same form as LISPSUPPORT and LAFITESUPPORT (and will continue to, even if we decide to change the address convention, since the smarts will now be localized).  Doesn't seem horrendously urgent, though, just if a new Tedit has to go out anyway.	Bill*start*00552 00024 US Date: 13 Mar 85 16:39 PSTFrom: Newman.pasaSubject: Lafite: LAFITEFIND bugTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Newman.pasaLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 10-Jan-85 13:28:55Machine: Dandelion (25200066464)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 5777Frequency: IntermittentImpact: MinorWhen I use the Find Related Forward subitem, the message printed says "no related messages found" regardless of the number of messages found.

The keys in the key file are encrypted using a "master key" which is currently simply the user's password.When a new key is created, it is assigned a new unique ID.  Keys are 8 byte long strings or byte arrays.  Key IDs are 6 bytes long (15 digit integers).  Each user who needs the key must then install that ID and key, along with a text name, into their keys file (via their Smalltalk user profile or the LetterWriter interface).When a user changes his password, the keys file must be reencrypted, but all of the other keys remain unchanged.[additional documentation available on request]*start*00565 00024 US Date: 18 Mar 85 16:50 PSTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Lafite: Change in USERNAME not noticedTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Kiewiet.pasaLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 14-Mar-85 18:10:14Machine: Dandelion (207#273#)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 5777Frequency: OnceImpact: ModerateI logged in in the a.m.  Another user logged in at my machine.

Now when you do an update, Lafite wants to make sure all the other folders have been completely written, so that it is safe to expunge the folder from which the messages had been moved.  This situation seems to tickle some bug in the Leaf code that attempts to recover from server crashes, leaving you where you are now.The easiest way out of this is as follows:  if you get a break like this doing an Expunge, ^ out of the break, since you DON'T want to expunge at this point.  Do an Update, choosing "write out changes only".  You will probably get a break underneath CLOSEF, trying to close some folder that you had done a MoveTo to.  Type (RETFROM 'CLOSEF) to get out of that break.Now look to see if you've lost anything (this is the reason not to do an Expunge earlier): Browse the folder that Lisp complained about in the break.  See if everything is there that you thought ought to be.  Sometimes, you will find that not all the messages that you moved into that folder are there, and/or that the last one is truncated.  If you care about any of the messages you lost, go back to the original folder and move them again.  Update everyone and you should be back in a good state.	Bill*start*00927 00024 USaDate: 20 Mar 85 16:42 PSTFrom: Martino.paSubject: Lafite Mail to VMSTo: Ricci.pa, VanMelle.pacc: Martino.pa, Fisher.pa, Dunn.pasaPaul & Bill,I was talking with a customer today who was asking me about "Lafite".

However, I thought that should be cleared with Bill first. I have subsequently talked with Bill, and he is interested in exploring the possibilities involved in letting Ken help. Note however, that this concerns Lafite code only; beyond that, nothing has been discussed. And even there, Bill is the one to call the shots here.

First the easy one: TOC files are always binary.As for the mail files themselves, if they have any Tedit messages in them, they must be binary.  Lafite does not actually explicitly specify the TYPE of mail files it creates.  When COPYFILES copies a typeless file somewhere, it infers the type by looking to see if there are any bytes with the high bit set.  That's how you get some TEXT, some BINARY.To further complicate the picture, some devices (IFS, for example) default the TYPE of a file to TEXT if you don't say otherwise.  This could get Lafite in trouble (i.e., this is a bug in Lafite), since if you then put a formatted message into the file, then copy the file to a server that cares about TYPE (or had the mail file on such a server to begin with), you might get the file garbled.  Fortunately, IFS's, DSK and FLOPPY don't care about TYPE.  But Tops20 does.	Bill*start*00400 00024 USaDate: 25 Mar 85 09:01 PSTFrom: Grimble.paSubject: Lafite: Erroneous IconTo: LafiteSupport.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Mar-85 14:48:35Machine: Dandelion (131#61#)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 5777Frequency: AlwaysImpact: Minor Why does the icon you get when you shrink an unsent Lafite letter have a cancelled stamp?Fran*start*00857 00024 USaDate: 25 Mar 85 16:22 PSTFrom: Grimble.paSubject: Lafite DocumentationTo: vanMelle.PAcc: Grimble.paI need the answers to these questions (and maybe others) before I can complete the documentation for review.1.

I have an application (a special BREAK package front-end for Trillium designers) requiring programmatically sending a message containing backtrace information.  Most of the message is automatically composed, but user input is also required.  It is imperative that a new process *NOT* be spawned for editing the message, although it would be okay to have just the send in a separate process, and that my process *always* has full control over the mouse.  I have been unsuccessful in finding the hooks into Lafite to achieve this.\SENDMESSAGE, and LAFITE.SENDMESSAGE are both unsatisfactory for me, the former because it seems to depend on being part of a separate process, and the latter because I would have to fire up my own Lafite-look-alike TEdit to complete the message form before using it.  Both functions, by the way, appear buggy, perhaps because of the way I'm playing with them.  I can't reliably exit/abort from \SENDMESSAGE without some undesirable side effect, such as having the EXEC process end up with a DON'T under PROCBEFOREEXIT.  LAFITE.SENDMESSAGE is often unsuccessful because the \GV parse and send fns find things they don't like, such as missing Format fields in the PARSE, and so on.I am in urgent (and immediate) need of any help and advice you can offer.Thanks!*start*01110 00024 US Date: 28 Mar 85 11:33 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Need help for programmatic SENDMESSAGEIn-reply-to: DSnyder.henr's message of 28 Mar 85 12:18 ESTTo: DSnyder.henrcc: LafiteSupport.paThe requirement that the code run in a separate process should not be a constraint.  You can always have your main process sit idle waiting for the other process to finish.  E.g., spawn a process and then do (PROCESS.RESULT <process handle> T), possibly wrapped in a RESETLST that would kill the other process if the user aborts you (if such a thing can happen).I'm not sure I understand your constraint about needing "full control over the mouse", since in your next paragraph you say that the problem with LAFITE.SENDMESSAGE is you'd have to make your own TEdit-like window to get the user input.  If you're planning to get the input with TEdit, what's wrong with the \SENDMESSAGE interface?  If you're composing the message by some other means, then LAFITE.SENDMESSAGE is the right interface.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Harmony; however, it's fixed in Intermezzo.	Bill*start*02084 00024 USaDate: 29 Mar 85 13:43 ESTFrom: DSnyder.henrSubject: Re: Lafite: Need help for programmatic SENDMESSAGEIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 28 Mar 85 11:33 PSTTo: vanMelle.pacc: DSnyder.henrBill,Thank you very much for your suggestions.  I did basically what you advised, and it seems to be working prefectly.  I'm not entirely clear on what you meant by using "a RESETLST that would kill the other process if the user aborts you"  Exactly what/who do you mean by "other process" and "you?"  Since the \SENDMESSAGE process is spawned with RESTARTABLE being NO, I assume I don't have to worry about it.  It's okay if process doing the spawning goes away on a RESET (or whatever), so I assume I don't have to do anything special for it either.As for using TEdit and maintaining control over the mouse, I achieved what I was after by using the following fn as TEdit's LOOPFN.  Perhaps you can recommend a better way to have done all this.  Again, I appreciate you help very much.David(LAMBDA NIL (* dls "29-Mar-85 12:41") (* The idea of this function is just to keep to mouse tied up while in TEdit, so the user can't, for example, bug a command in the Trillium menu.

But that's probably not going to happen anyway, since you are maintaining complete control over the mouse, which means that the user can't redirect the tty back to your waiting process in order to abort it.  Of course, this means the user could be trapped there if the sendmessage never finishes (e.g., if the net is down).As for random suggestions, you might want to know about the function WINDOWREGION.  E.g., (WINDOWREGION EDITORWINDOW) will return a region which is the union of EDITORWINDOW and all its attached windows.	Bill*start*00702 00024 USaDate: 30 Mar 85 17:52 ESTFrom: DSnyder.henrSubject: Re: Lafite: Need help for programmatic SENDMESSAGEIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 28 Mar 85 11:33 PSTTo: vanMelle.pacc: DSnyder.henrBill -- Thanks again for your help and suggestions; they are much appreciated!

If a 'From' field existed already, a 'Sender' field is generated instead to contain that truth.'Reply-to' is never automatically filled in, but is prompted for if a dl is detected.If you want to programmatically add fields to a form, you could try advising selected functions.  MAKEANSWERFORM creates the answer form; MAKEFORWARDFORM creates a forward form.  They both return a TEXTSTREAM, which is what is passed along for the user to edit further.  So you could, for example, (ADVISE 'MAKEANSWERFORM 'AFTER '(TEDIT.INSERT !VALUE "From: LispSupport.PAReply-to: LispSupport.PA")).As a Lafite feature, I'm not sure what to make of it.

Outside users get those forms iff the LISPSUPPORT, LAFITESUPPORT etc variables have been set appropriately.Re an acknowledgement section, I am ambivalent; perhaps a policy decision is in order.  We don't in general acknowledge contributors to random library packages.  But there is an acknowledgement section in the manual...  At any rate, if there is to be an acknowledgements section, we should include Henry Thompson, who implemented the first version of the Grapevine interface (long before Lafite ever existed); Beau Sheil and (I think) Richard Burton worked on an early version of Lafite (you should ask them for details; I'm very fuzzy about what went on before me); and Martin Yonke, who got the first "working version" running in 1983.  I took it over in late 83 and substantially reworked it into the present implementation.Re GV vs NS addresses.  On the Xerox Internet (over in OSD, actually), there is a mail gateway that allows NS mail to be sent to Grapevine addresses, or Grapevine mail to NS addresses.  This gateway is not officially supported as of this writing, but it is in regular use, so it's worth knowing that it's there and how it works.How to specify addresses: Grapevine addresses are normally of the form 'name.registry', while NS addressses are normally of the form 'name:domain:org'.  The mail gateway provides pseudo-registries and pseudo-domains for mail addressed to the other kind of network.  Thus, you can send mail to addresses of the other kind without changing Lafite mode to do it; a single message can contain both Grapevine and NS addresses.  Details:Lafite in GV mode:  To send mail to the NS address 'name:domain:org', address it to '"name:domain:org".ns' (the double quotes are needed to keep the colon and any spaces in the name from being misparsed).  For convenience, the domains 'PARC', 'OSBU North' and 'OSBU South' can also be addressed as the registry of the same name, spaces removed.  Thus, to send mail to 'Fred:PARC:Xerox', send it to 'Fred.PARC'; to send mail to 'Oscar:OSBU North:Xerox', send it it 'Oscar.OSBUNorth'.Lafite in NS mode: To send mail to the GV address 'name.reg', address it to 'name.reg:GV'.  For convenience, the registries PA and ES can be addressed directly as NS domains.  Thus, to send mail to 'Arthur.pa', send it to 'Arthur:PA'.*start*00409 00024 US Date:  4 Apr 85 15:35 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: Lafite: Can't browse folders on NS fileserversIn-reply-to: Raim.pasa's message of 4 Apr 85 14:33 PSTTo: Raim.pasacc: LafiteSupport.paIndeed, that is why the documentation says "your mail file must reside on a device that supports random access", such as {DSK}.

It's pretty nifty.  Naturally, I have lots of comments.   Substantive ones first:1.  You allow interrupts while playing a message, which works well, but not during the header.  This gets aggravating after a while.  Some headers can be quite long.  I have two suggestions here.  One is that you not speak the entire list of addresses if it is long.  The second, more important one, is that while speaking the header, listen for * or #.  If you hear *, immediately abort the header (and don't play the body).  If you hear #, finish speaking the header, but don't bother saying "# to hear the message, * not to" (however that's worded).  I found that I often knew, well before you finished reading the header, that I didn't want to hear a particular message, so I'd press *# to go on (which worked most of the time (sometimes it missed the *), but I still had to sit through the rest of the header and subsequent prompt).2.  It would be nice if it were optimized for scanning thru new messages, much as Lafite automatically advances to the next message, if unexamined, when you delete a message.  True, it's not too much of a hassle to hit # to hear each new message, but it seems suboptimal.  My proposal is that if the user declines to hear a message (*) or aborts it (**), and the next message is unexamined, the reader should automatically advance.  I don't propose that in the case that the user listens to the whole message, since maybe s/he wants to do something else, like hear it again...  hmm, I guess that argues against doing it for the abort case, too.  If you only did it in the case where I declined to listen to the message at all, that would certainly satisfy me mostly.3.  Speaking of which, as far as a I can tell, there is no convenient way to say "play that one again".  I don't usually notice the number of the message at the outset.4.  It wasn't immediately obvious to me that when you interrupt a message with *, you press another * to abort, since all it prompts you to do is back up or change the speed.5.  I often found it hard to understand the From field.  I think this mostly happens in messages from the Arpanet, which often have strange junk in the from field.  Not sure I have a suggestion here, although a little more space around the "@" might help.6.  The speaker needs to pause at paragraph breaks (blank lines).  This is most noticeable when playing forwarded messages, where the reader laboriously speaks the header and immediately launches into the body without break....and less substantive comments (humorous observations and such)...7.  When listening to headers, it took me a while to figure out that it was speaking a date.  Not sure whether it was speaking "April" and doing it badly, or if it was trying to pronounce "Apr".8.  Messages forwarded from Grapevine to NS (and then back again, if you're reading GV mail) sometimes have a section that contains the original GV header, surrounded by long lines of "GVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGV".  Quite humorous when read.  You might want to notice such cases and throw out those lines, as well as everything in between them (which tends to be redundant header info).9.  I found it cute how it read full file names, pronouncing all the >'s as "greater than".  I'm not entirely sure how it SHOULD read those, but I think treating the <, >, {} etc as spaces would work well.10.  Other humorous pronunciations: "awry".  Also, Lispy messages get fun, as it doesn't known about the foo-p convention.  I had a message from Larry that contained "fixp", "numberp", and the most humorously pronounced of all, "smallp".11.  Are "slant" and "backslant" common utterances?  I usually call / and \ "slash" and "backslash".12.  It occasionally said something about pressing a key to keep the connection alive even when it hadn't been idle.  Puzzling.Well, that's enough for now.  Good work.  If you fix (1), I might even feel like using this more often.	Billp.s. it occurs to me you might want to make arrangements for folks who read NS mail.  We can talk about this sometime.*start*00605 00024 US Date:  9 Apr 85 12:00 PSTFrom: BrianSmith.paSubject: Lafite: Suggestion: Middle button automatically expungeTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: BrianSmith.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 19-Mar-85 14:48:35Machine: Dorado (Smith)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 10000I don't think I have ever closed a mail folder without selecting the strongest option (typically "expunge deleted messages"), although I appreciate the possibility of being able to do so.

Are you saying that while the arguement to DELFILE may be a filename, the arg to MS is a foldername and therefore not modified by conn?  The doc says it is a filename?That conn is ignored seems inconsistent within the more general context of invoking functions via the lisp exec.  If MS were a request made to/within Lafite I would agree that it might have a right to make a local modification.  For example, if I am working within Tedit, having previously CONN 'ed to some directory location, the system seems to be working predictably when I can GET a file using only the simple file name, i.e. the more global effect of CONN is still in force. Indeed, if I try to get a file in a different subdirectory using a simple filename I get the msg 'file not found', and this seems to be quite reasonable.  If on the other hand, conn were ignored, I wouldn't be as happy,  (now I have to do more work) but I could understand that the global effect had been overridden.

Our belief is that Lafite sometimes produces unparsable files, but only thru very unusual circumstances (such as the simultaneous use mentioned above) is mail ever irretrievably lost.As for what to do now, run the function MAILSCAVENGE from the LispUsers package MAILOPS.As for how to avoid this situation, I can say that these problems occur less frequently when you keep your mail files on {DSK} and periodically back them up to a file server, a suitable strategy if you have your own machine and your disk is reliable enough that the probability of losing its contents are sufficiently low.	Bill*start*01616 00024 US Date: 23 Apr 85 16:40 ESTFrom: Rees.wbstSubject: Re: Lafite: every other message deletedIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 23 Apr 85 11:44 PSTTo: vanMelle.pacc: Rees.wbst, LafiteSupport.paThanks for the quick response.I did not abort the expunge (at least not intentionally).Please explain more about 2 different machines - same account or different ones? I only use my machine but lots (20 or so) of people here use Lafite and Ice for storing their message folders."Every other message deleted" - good ones (not marked ) about 75 of them considering there were 200+ in the file and I seem to have a fragment of another message's header merged to each header. Of course, these may have been left over from somewhere else, can't tell.After running the mailscavenge function, this is what I got:89  27 Feb  Cowden.wbst    Message title90  27 Feb  ---     		    ---[47 chars]with this pattern of legitimate message followed by a fragment of a message. This goes on for 256 messages. It says I have 348 messages in the file. I checked some of the fragments, they were definitely once different messages and contain different parts of different headers - not related to each other or to the surrounding surviving messages.The next to the last "funny" message is 254  *start	MRees.wbst	---[47 chars]255   20 Feb	okay message256	20 Feb	---			---[47 chars]257   all the rest seem to be okayThanks anyway, I seem to have recovered what counts. If you would like more information or would like the files (before scavenge and after) I wouldn't mind sharing them. Nancy*start*02183 00024 US Date: 23 Apr 85 11:16 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: [Zaenen.pa: Lafite: lafite doesn't update]In-reply-to: LispSupport.PA's message of 23 Apr 85 09:53 PSTTo: LispSupport.PAcc: LispFriends^.paReply-to: vanMelle.paThis has been happening often enough with file server crashes around here that until we fix the bug that is responsible (and everyone is using the version of the system with the bug fix in it), we should probably include the following general advice about how to get out of this state.State: Update or Expunge brings up break window "file server connection lost" for some mail file, usually one that you had used as the destination of a MoveTo command.Comments: This usually happens when you move some message(s) into another folder, but before you do an Update, the remote file server crashes.  Now when you do an update, Lafite wants to make sure all the other folders have been completely written, so that it is safe to expunge the folder from which the messages had been moved.  This situation seems to tickle some bug in the Leaf code that attempts to recover from server crashes, leaving you where you are now.Action: The easiest way out of this is as follows:  if you get a break like this doing an Expunge, ^ out of the break, since you DON'T want to expunge at this point.  Do an Update, choosing "write out changes only".  You will probably get a break underneath CLOSEF, trying to close some folder to which you had done a MoveTo.  Type (RETFROM 'CLOSEF) to get out of that break.  If the break is not underneath CLOSEF it is probably under FORCEOUTPUT, in which case you should type (RETFROM 'FORCEOUTPUT) instead.Now look to see if you've lost anything (this is the reason not to do an Expunge earlier): Browse the folder that Lisp complained about in the break.  See if everything is there that you thought ought to be.  Sometimes, you will find that not all the messages that you moved into that folder are there, and/or that the last one is truncated.  If you care about any of the messages you lost, go back to the original folder and move them again.  Update everyone and you should be back in a good state.*start*00807 00024 US Date: 24 Apr 85 11:15 PSTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: LAFITE: NS VERSIONS OF MAIL NOTESIn-reply-to: "William Pickles".IHAIL's message of 24 Apr 85 00:36:13 PST (Wednesday)To: "William Pickles".IHAILcc: 1100Support.PASA, MG.IHAIL, LAFITESUPPORT.PAWe can't change NSMAIL.DCOM to do that, because not everyone (internal Xerox vs external) should have the same support addresses.If you want to fix your own site's Lafite to send to the same Grapevine addresses as the rest of Xerox, do it in your init file by adding the following to your INITCOMS:(ADDVARS (LISPSUPPORT (NS "LispSupport:PA:Xerox"))	(LAFITESUPPORT (NS "LafiteSupport:PA:Xerox"))	(TEDITSUPPORT (NS "TEditSupport:PA:Xerox")))Billps.

This is an erroneous error message but it does signal a failure of the attempt to store the Mail Note.The Mailnote was apparrently successfully processed through the NS Mail Service and the Star user interface for mail and can be manipulated on the Star Desktop but it cannot be stored onto the file service.I have experienced this phenomenon with multiple Mailnotes but they have all come from the same source (Pete).  I believe Don Winter has had a similar experience on other physical file servers with messages from Pete.If you wish, I can place the problem Mailnote in a container (folder) and mail it to you at an NS address of your choice.-- Max*start*01135 00024 USaDate: 26 Apr 85 14:56 PSTFrom: Mersfelder.pasaSubject:  [Magnus Ljungberg <Magnus@SRI-AI.ARPA>: Intermezzo Beta]To: LafiteSupport.pacc: Mersfelder.pasaPlease note these problems reported by Syntelligence as an Intermezzo beta site-Janet     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----Return-Path: <MAGNUS@SRI-AI.ARPA>Received: from SRI-AI.ARPA by Xerox.ARPA ; 18 APR 85 19:17:29 PSTDate: Thu, 18 Apr 85 19:15:32 PSTFrom: Magnus Ljungberg <Magnus@SRI-AI.ARPA>Subject: Intermezzo BetaTo: 1100Support.PA(1)	 When Lafite is turned on it (nearly) allways breaks with a "unexpected end of stream while reading Courier response".

No, it is not a coincidence that he breaks more often at byte 3204 = 6*534.  The timeout bug that the SIU patch addresses is exactly that case: you open a connection to read a file, the server blasts out 6 packets worth of data, Lisp busies itself with swapping in some code and printing out "File Created" etc, during which time the server doesn't hear an ack from Lisp and shuts down the connection, all in a grand 5 seconds.	Bill*start*15481 00024 US Date: 26 Apr 85 17:12 PSTFrom: Burwell.paSubject: Lafite: Possible update problem of cursorTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Burwell.paFormat: TEditLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 16-Apr-85 13:02:15Machine: Dandelion (131#105#)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 15777Frequency: OnceImpact: MinorI had done an update before shrinking.

My idea for a mechanism to do this is introduce the notion of a "sub-browser".  You select a set of messages and then ask to subbrowse them.  This gives you a new browser window containing those messages only, with its own selection pointer, etc.  Anything you do to a message in the subbrowser happens to the message in the main browser as well.  Subbrowsers have all the normal commands except Update and Get Mail.	Bill*start*00527 00024 US Date: 29 Apr 85 15:09 PDTFrom: Kiewiet.pasaSubject: Re: Lafite: Wish for Find/Display/Move-To enhancementIn-reply-to: vanMelle.pa's message of 29 Apr 85 14:23 PDTTo: vanMelle.pacc: Kiewiet.pasa, LafiteSupport.paYeah!

The Arpa mail gateway processes all the mail to/from the Arpanet and various other networks. The GV<=>NS mail gateway connects Grapevine with the product mail system. NS mail users can get mail to/from the Arpanet by going through both gateways.I don't think there is anything interesting in this message for those of you who don't use either gateway. Does that include anybody?Jody: Please forward this to the NS people that I've missed. Thanks. ------If you send an NS message to a GV user that doesn't exist, for example, because you mistyped the name, GV sends you back a rejection notice. It also sends a msg to me, John, and Ron. These problems should be intercepted in the NS=>GV mail gateway, but it isn't easy to do.Yesterday, we got 40 messages. That's typical. I'm a mail junkie, but it's chewing up a lot of my time to wade through all of this extra trash. (The Grapevine system depends upon people to hear it's calls for help, so somebody has to inspect them all.)PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be careful when you type in names that will go through the NS=>GV mail gateway. Only YOU can avoid clutter in MY mailbox.Hint: No GV name (xxx:ES, xxx:PA, xxx:RX...) contains a space.------The header format for Grapevine mail uses the Arpa rules. In particular, things inside ()s are comments, and names inside <>s are "source routing" which makes the rest of the name into a comment. Many people have taken advantage of this to setup a personalized new-msg form containing lines like these:	From: (Hal) Murray	From: Hal <Murray>NS mail doesn't support that concept. If you are using NSHardy or the new MailTool and you have personalized mail forms, please check to be sure that you don't have any ()s or <>s in unreasonable places. The NS=>GV mail gateway properly quotes them, but GV users won't be able to Answer your message. On the GV side, the previous example would look like:	 From: "(Hal) Murray".osbunorthSince "(Hal) Murray" isn't an alias for Murray:OSBU North, there isn't any way to deliver a msg to that user.PS: Please don't include an @Xerox in your From field. The header munger in the Arpa mail gateway will add it. ("header munger" is a technical term.)------A msg from Xerox recently caused a lot of confusion out in the Arpa world. Several machines were crashing every half hour whenever they tried to receive the msg. I don't understand all the fine print, but the critical item was a space in a From field. (Many Unix mail systems don't believe that names can have spaces or quotes.) I don't want us to get a nasty reputation so I added a trap to the Arpa mail gateway.If you want to send a msg to the Arpanet from NSHardy or the MailTool, you will have to login using an alias that doesn't have any spaces. Murray:OSBU North will work. By the time it gets to GV, it looks like Murray.osbunorth. Hal Murray:OSBU North gets translated to "Hal Murray".osbunorth. That has a space, so it will get rejected. So will mail from "(Hal) Murray".osbunorth.The no-spaces trap checks the From field in the header of the msg. Don't panic if you notice that the Sender field has spaces. That doesn't get checked.There is also a sender field in the envelope of the msg. (It shows up in the Return-Path line that gets added to the top of the msg when it gets to the final recipient.) We had a lot of troubles with that too. (Again, mostly Unix sites.) We doged around that mess by translating spaces to back arrows (underbars in Arpa land) on the way out to Arpa sites and inverting the translation for mail going to GV.------Many Grapevine users still use an old fashoned character set.If you are sending mail to GV users from Hardy 11.1, or through the NS=>GV mail gateway, please be careful about using funny characters.

There were two break windows on the screen.  One was server connection broken on the {phylum}active.mail file.  The other was "Tail of Queue has non-NIL link PTR:". ( I copied the queue down if that helps.).  When I tried to get a BT from this window I got "Stack PTR has been released".  I eventually ^'ed it.  The connection broken window would not take the tty, nor pop up the break menu on middle button.  There was no process that looked like it might be associated with it.  I closed it.  After this all attempts to deal with Lafite met with "file server connection broken".  I tried getmail, I did a BREAKCONNECTION(PHYLUM) followed by getmail, I tried Update - expunging, I tried closing the browser without updating.  Even LOGOUT met with "file server connection broken".  I began to get the impression that Lafite had cached a stream that was garbaged so I looked up the stack and returned NIL from CLOSEF.   This allowed the browse window to close. When I reopened the browser, it reported a bad message length in the last message of the file.  I scavenged it and was then able to browse it.Without me available, Dana would have had to reload FULL which would (I believe) have resulted in the same state I got to after reverting to CLOSEF.  It would be nice if there were some way to trap this error so Lafite could continue.Richard *start*00404 00024 US Date:  3 May 85 17:37 EDTFrom: denber.wbstSubject: Lafite: Find is Great!To: LafiteSupport.paLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 16-Apr-85 13:02:15Machine: Dandelion (Orion1)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 5777The new Find feature in Lafite is a big help to those of us who keep humungo mail files - and it's fast too!

If it finds one without a space, use that instead.  Alternatively, the gv/ns gateway, which certainly does have clearinghouse code, could massage names going thru the gateway.I suppose I could kludge up Lafite to effectively do the same.  If there is any address in the message containing a @, then use the spaceless alias in the From field instead of the canonical name.  I don't in general like sending NS mail with an alias in the From field, since then there is no quick way the receiver can know whether the From field and the actual sender of the message are the same, and therefore know that the sender field ("Originator") is superfluous.Doesn't Star have this problem worse?  Or does Star let you log in using an alias, and keep that alias as your From field?	Bill*start*01870 00024 US Date:  3 May 85 17:48:08 PDTFrom: Murray.paSubject: Re: [Murray.pa: Mail gateway news and plea for help]In-reply-to: "vanMelle's message of 3 May 85 16:37 PDT"To: vanMelleCc: Masinter, LafiteSupport, MurrayFirst, the easy parts. Cedar doesn't have any Clearinghouse code. Getting Al Hall to fix the gv/ns gateway is a lost cause. I can't (yet) get him/them to fix the stupid bug that's injecting a lot of mail into my mailbox, and I've been screaming about it for months. (It will take a bit of work.) It doesn't yet to anything spacial about Arpa names, so adding that sort of hack is a bit evil.At the time that I did the space/underbar hack, I convinced myself it would work. It's working only on the names within the envelope, and it knows which direction things are going, so it knows that all the names it's processing ar GV names. I'm willing to claim I'm the GV czar and tell anybody that they can't have a backarrow in their name (or put one in a DL name). Actually, you can do it, you just have to make an alias with a space in it.Now that I think of it, this might actually fail. Consider a user out there somplace in Arpa land that sends a msg to one of our DLs with Arpa people on it. If that persons name has a space, I'll turn it into an underbar. (It gets complicated by the Owners- hackery.)Headers are more complicated. There isn't any easy way to tell if a name is local or not. Thus I might "fix" a name that shouldn't get fixed.Tajo lets you log in using an alias, and then the MailTools (aka NSHardy) uses that alias in the From field. I don't know what Star does.The bottom line is that many Unix systems are allergic to names containing spaces. If you want to send them mail and you also want to be able to send mail to people whos systems have spaces in their names, things are going to get interesting.*start*00831 00024 US Date:  7 May 85 11:15 PDTFrom: Newman.pasaSubject: Lafite: File Server down confuses LafiteTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Newman.pasaLafite System Date: 15-Nov-84 14:03:34Lisp System Date: 24-Apr-85 19:03:36Machine: Dandelion (25200066464)Microcode version: 24,4Memory size: 5777Frequency: IntermittentImpact: MinorTrying to browse a Lafite mail file on a server that is not responding causes Lafite to go into the "click left to confirm creation of XXX.mail" routine.

At any rate it's still a problem:You can get in trouble if you try to make things happen while a "get mail" is in progress (which is easy to do if "get mail" takes a long time, such as when one of the two servers is down).For example, suppose message n is selected while the "get mail" is in progress, and that you button "move to".  The folder menu comes up, and you choose a destination; all looks well.  But the move doesn't actually happen until the "get mail" returns, at which point (if there was new mail) the message selector is first updated to the first of the new messages, and that new message is then (incorrectly) moved.Presumably all operations should be disallowed during "get mails"?

Display and Update are perhaps the only ones it ever makes sense to "button ahead" during GetMail.  It would be nice to arrange that GetMail not lock out operations on the current contents of the browser, but that's a more major undertaking.	Bill*start*01244 00024 US Date: 10 May 85 11:41 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: problem with Lisp's mail sender talking to PC Xmail readerTo: Hodges.OsbuNorthcc: vanMelle.pa, Troisi.OsbuNorthBrenda suggested I talk to you about this one.

A gateway from Grapevine to NS mail has been introduced that allows communication between the two mail systems. This gateway has allowed many people who used to send all of their mail through Grapevine to send all of their mail through NS instead. This message, for example, has been sent to you from the NS mail system.GV messages from the NS mail system will have strange registrys, like OSBUNorth or SBDERX. The sender field of this message is a good example. For example, a message to Read.OSBUNorth will go through the gateway to Read:OSBU North:Xerox.A list of the special registries and the domains they correspond to is stored on [Indigo]<Registrar>GV>GV-NS-Mapping.txt. It's changing reasonably rapidly so don't be too surprised if you see names that are not on the list.There are limited recources devoted to the GV-NS mail gateway. Please do NOT use it unless you are sending to or from one of the domains in the "official" users list. (A snapshot of the list is in the file mentioned above.)If you are interested in switching your GV mail, contact Jody Read. (Read.OSBUNorth, or Read:OSBU North)If you are sending mail from NS to a GV user, remember that no GV names contain spaces. The main GV registrys are PA, SV, PASA, ES, DLOS, WBST, HENR, RX, FX, and X.*start*00583 00024 US Date: 16 May 85 17:49 PDTFrom: Raim.pasaSubject: Lafite: "Folder is empty" inappropriateTo: LafiteSupport.pacc: Raim.pasaLafite System Date: 12-Mar-85 03:12:27Lisp System Date: 16-Apr-85 13:02:15Machine: Dandelion (207#55#)Microcode version: 26,24Memory size: 5777Frequency: AlwaysImpact: AnnoyingI deleted all messages from a mail folder and "Folder is empty" was appropriately displayed.

"long" means that there was a line with more than 90 characters within the first 5000 characters of the body of the message.This, of course, makes a real mess if you have already folded things at a slightly longer length. If you don't want your message to get folded, include a line containing "Line-fold: no" in your header.*start*01665 00024 USaDate: 22 May 85 08:31:35 PDTFrom: Murray.paSubject: .ARPA, .AG, and .ArpaGatewayTo: MessageSystemImplementors^.paCc: Murray, JLarson, Swinehart, RWeaverReply-to: Murray.paWay back in the old days, "ArpaGateway" was the "foreign" registry used to hand Arpa mail from GV to Maxc. When mail to/from the UUCP world arrived, and all their bangity!bangity!very!long!names appeared on the scene, various names started to exceed the 64 character limit within GV. "AG" was setup as another "foreign" registry that also pointed to Maxc to save a few characters. Then the ARPA folks decided to use domain style naming (like foo.bar.arpa), so ARPA was added to the list too.Why am I cluttering up your mailbox?Well, the ARPA folks are finally starting to use domain style naming. You will soon see mumble.EDU and mumble.COM.The problem is that various mail systems "automatically" append .AG to any name that contains an @. With the new names, that's going to be confusing at best.I think the correct rule should be:If a name contains an "@", but no "." (after the @), append a ".ARPA".That will let the old user@host case work while avoiding mashing names that already end with an appropiate (foreign) registry.This isn't a big deal, but it will help to reduce the clutter and confusion. Hardy 10.0 or such ALWAYS appends a .ARPA, so I'm already stuck with maintaining the code to translate .ARPA.ARPA into .ARPA. (If the code isn't there already, I can easily fixup any other registrys that get trampled.)GV is now setup to forward COM, EDU, GOV, and MIL (as well as ARPA, BITNET, CSNet, and Mailnet) to the "Arpa" mail gateway.*start*00530 00024 US Date: 23 May 85 16:03 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: Re: .ARPA, .AG, and .ArpaGatewayIn-reply-to: Murray.pa's message of 22 May 85 08:31:35 PDTTo: Murray.pacc: vanMelle.paLafite is at the other extreme, in that it NEVER appends ".ARPA" to a name.   It just sends all names containing @ verbatim to the AG registry (two-part name is name = whatever user typed; registry = AG).   Thus, it is relying on the gateway defaulting the domain to ARPA if one is not specified.  Is this going to change?	Bill*start*00804 00024 US Date: 22 May 85 10:42:59 PDTFrom: Murray.paSubject: Smoldering bridgesTo: ArpanetUsers^.XCc: MurrayReply-to: Murray.paThe ARPA community is in the process of switching to domain style names. Within the next month or two, you will start to see names like RICE.EDU, ERNIE.BERKELEY.EDU, and WHITE.SWW.Symbolics.COM where you usually see host.ARPA.I just activated the code to use the distributed name servers out on the arpanet rather than looking in our local copy of HOSTS.TXT.I expect a few minor fires, but I hope there won't be any serious conflagrations.

The purpose and expected use of   domains is to divide the name management required of a central   administration and assign it to sub-administrations.  There are no   geographical, topological, or technological constraints on a domain.   The hosts in a domain need not have common hardware or software, nor   even common protocols.  Most of the requirements and limitations on   domains are designed to ensure responsible administration.   The domain system is a tree-structured global name space that has a   few top level domains.  The top level domains are subdivided into   second level domains.  The second level domains may be subdivided   into third level domains, and so on.   ..General Purpose Domains   While the initial domain name "ARPA" arises from the history of the   development of this system and environment, in the future most of the   top level names will be very general categories like "government",   "education", or "commercial".  The motivation is to provide an   organization name that is free of undesirable semantics.   After a short period of initial experimentation, all current   ARPA-Internet hosts will select some domain other than ARPA for their   future use.  The use of ARPA as a top level domain will eventually   cease.Initial Set of Top Level Domains   The initial top level domain names are:      Temporary         ARPA  =  The current ARPA-Internet hosts.      Categories         GOV  =  Government, any government related domains meeting the                 second level requirements.         EDU  =  Education, any education related domains meeting the                 second level requirements.         COM  =  Commercial, any commercial related domains meeting the                 second level requirements.         MIL  =  Military, any military related domains meeting the                 second level requirements.         ORG  =  Organization, any other domains meeting the second                 level requirements.      Countries         The English two letter code (alpha-2) identifying a country         according the the ISO Standard for "Codes for the         Representation of Names of Countries" --------------------------------------------------------------------------*start*00386 00024 US Date: 22 May 85 19:10 PDTFrom: vanMelle.paSubject: yet newer NSMAILTo: Raim.pasacc: vanMelle.paLarry discovered a bug I introduced in the version of NSMAIL I gave you, wherein old messages that had attachments continued to be retrieved every time you did a GetMail.
