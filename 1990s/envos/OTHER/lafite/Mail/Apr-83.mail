Thanks. TWF)I'm working on a project involving user-constructed mail "filters".What we would like to build is a rule-driven expert system which willORDER one's electronic mail on the basis of the message attributes.We don't want to actually filter out unimportant messages, just rankthe current (or incomming) ones.The kinds of attributes we are imagining using are things like:  - has the message been read?, header seen?, answered?  - age of message  - sender's identity (e.g. RPG@SAIL), address (BBNA), local vs. network  - keywords in subject field and message body  - apparent "type" of message body (e.g. pascal code, lisp code,  - manner we became a recipient (e.g. only addressee, one of several    addressees, as a member of a mailing list, a carbon copy, forwarded...)  - size of message  - etc.We expect to rank messages with along several dimensions, such asINTEREST, URGENT and IMPORTANCE, and then have rules which combinethese rankings to produce an overall ordering of the messages.A crucial aspect to this project would be to provide an environment inwhich it would be easy for the USER to examine, understand, specify andmodify the rules which drive the system.  We are aiming for a class ofusers which includes those technically oriented but having noprogramming knowledge of experience.  We might, for example, allowrules like:   if the sender is TIM.UPENN@UDEL               ; this fellow sends very       then INTEREST is VERY LIKELY to be HIGH    ; interesting messages.   if the RECIPIENT is a MAILING LIST            ; if the mail is not personal      then URGENCY is LIKELY to be LOW           ; then it's prob. not urgent.   if the source is LOCAL                        ; local (non network) mail has      then the IMPORTANCE MAY be HIGH            ; many important messages.   if the SIZE is > 200 LINES or the TYPE is PASCAL ; very big messages and      then the URGENCY MAY be LOW                   ; programs aren't urgent.   if the URGENCY is > MEDIUM and the IMPORTANCE is NOT LOW ; rankfrom other      then the RANK is VERY HIGH                            ; measuresI know that there has bee a fair amount of work in the area ofautomatic mail filters, routers and the like.  I'm interested ingetting pointers to people, projects and relevant publications. I'dalso like to talk to people who have to deal with a large number ofincomming messages (e.g. > 20).  I would like to know how they managethe task of reading their mail (old and new) already and what featuresthey would like to see in an mail-sorting expert system.I would greatly appreciate any information, advice or ideas you couldgive me.Thanks,Tim Finin------------------------------------------------------------*start*00664 00024 US Date:  8-APR-83 14:02:40 PDTFrom: Yonke.PASubject: after Get MailTo: Burton, VanMelle, Masinter, Sybalsky, Gadolcc: Yonke.PAthere is a new bug introduced such that after it gets new mail it doesn't select the first recent message and the 'No New Mail...' doesn't get updated immediately.

It started by Active.mail truely having a bad mail file format -- there were 23 nulls at the end of the legitmate messages and we should talk about how it got in that state (is it possible the filesystem might have done this?).  By the way, I fixed your badactive.mail and it's in my directory as vanmelle.mail.  I don't know how you got out of the error, but at the end it thought your mail file name was NIL (how did you "invoke Lafite again"?).  Because the mail file name was NIL, when you called 'Quit' Lafite generated a file name ".NIL-LAFITE-TOC;1" (my bug) which unfortunately Interlisp-D was happy to create (isn't this a bug?  on no other implementation of Interlisp can you open a file with a null NAME).  Anyway, you found someplaces where Lafite should be more careful, but as I said they've always been there.  There still is the question of how active.mail  got clobbered and I'll come to talk to you about that.Thanks for the report.Martin*start*00756 00024 US Date: 11-APR-83 17:00:31 PDTFrom: Yonke.PASubject: Re: Newest Lafite badly damagedIn-reply-to: vanMelle.PA's message of 10-APR-83 12:28:02 PDTTo: vanMelle.PAcc: Yonke.PA, LispSupport.PAThere is a new Lafite on Fugue which fixes your problems.  The problem happened because if file F is opened for output and you do 	(SETFILEINFO F 'LENGTH 100)	(CLOSEF F)then (GETFILEINFO F 'LENGTH) will be 100 if the filepointer was less than 100.  If the filepointer was greater than 100 then the LENGTH is the filepointer and everthing between 100 and the filepointer has been zeroed out.  This is how the bad formated mail file was generated.I consider this a bug in the filesystem, but I have programmed around it for now.Martin*start*01721 00024 US Date: 13-Apr-83 17:15:06 pdtFrom: Yonke.PASubject: new LafiteTo: Burton, VanMelle, Masinter, Sybalsky, Gadol, Sheilcc: Yonke.PAThere is a new Lafite on Fugue (and Lispusers) that has many "cracks patched" and a bug fix.  In addition it has several of your suggestions implemented (but not all -- next release for everything).Things you should watch for:'Quit' in the browser menu is now 'Update' - i.e. "expunge" but don't leave the browser.  There is a CLOSEFN which will do the old 'Quit' (with a "mouse confirm").There is a new order in the browser menu - 'Display' is on the left and is next to 'Delete' (for less mouse movement).The var LAFITEDEFAULTHOST&DIR no longer exists.  It is replaced by a a function by the same name that takes HOST&DIR as its argument.  This allows for some error checking and it munges some menus in the appropriate ways.  If you call it with no arguments it returns the current value.  If you call it with a legit HOST&DIR argument it returns the previous value.The variables LAFITEDISPLAYREGION and LAFITEDISPLAYFONT are now as documented (i.e. the documentation matches the implementation).I'll have updated documentation soon, but I figure this should be enough for you guys.Please don't load this Lafite into a system with an old Lafite (e.g. some INITVARS have changed).  And would you delete all files *LAFITE-TOC* on your disk and fileserver.  Nothing bad will happen if you don't but you will have extraneous files laying around that will be harder to specify the delete path later than before you run the new Lafite.MartinP.S.

The submenu entry "Another Form" might better be called "Other Form", lest one confuse it with having two regular forms up at once.4.

Ascenario might be to set a bunch of flags on messages, such as:	hardcopy this one eventually	I need to answer this one	I need to answer these messages	these messages need forwarding eventually, but not right nowand then apply the appropriate operation to the various groups of messages. Hardcopying is perhaps the easiest.  These should probably be impervious todeletions; that is, if a message is marked for hardcopy and deletion, and you quit(expunge) before the hardcopy is done, something intelligent should be done(like either don't expunge the message but leave it marked for deletion, don't letthe expunge happen until appropriately confirmed, etc.).None of this is easy, but it encompases a lot of the things that I want to be ableto do, but haven't been able to do easily in any message system.

Thanks. TWF)I'm working on a project involving user-constructed mail "filters".What we would like to build is a rule-driven expert system which willORDER one's electronic mail on the basis of the message attributes.We don't want to actually filter out unimportant messages, just rankthe current (or incomming) ones.The kinds of attributes we are imagining using are things like:  - has the message been read?, header seen?, answered?  - age of message  - sender's identity (e.g. RPG@SAIL), address (BBNA), local vs. network  - keywords in subject field and message body  - apparent "type" of message body (e.g. pascal code, lisp code,  - manner we became a recipient (e.g. only addressee, one of several    addressees, as a member of a mailing list, a carbon copy, forwarded...)  - size of message  - etc.We expect to rank messages with along several dimensions, such asINTEREST, URGENT and IMPORTANCE, and then have rules which combinethese rankings to produce an overall ordering of the messages.A crucial aspect to this project would be to provide an environment inwhich it would be easy for the USER to examine, understand, specify andmodify the rules which drive the system.  We are aiming for a class ofusers which includes those technically oriented but having noprogramming knowledge of experience.  We might, for example, allowrules like:   if the sender is TIM.UPENN@UDEL               ; this fellow sends very       then INTEREST is VERY LIKELY to be HIGH    ; interesting messages.   if the RECIPIENT is a MAILING LIST            ; if the mail is not personal      then URGENCY is LIKELY to be LOW           ; then it's prob. not urgent.   if the source is LOCAL                        ; local (non network) mail has      then the IMPORTANCE MAY be HIGH            ; many important messages.   if the SIZE is > 200 LINES or the TYPE is PASCAL ; very big messages and      then the URGENCY MAY be LOW                   ; programs aren't urgent.   if the URGENCY is > MEDIUM and the IMPORTANCE is NOT LOW ; rankfrom other      then the RANK is VERY HIGH                            ; measuresI know that there has bee a fair amount of work in the area ofautomatic mail filters, routers and the like.  I'm interested ingetting pointers to people, projects and relevant publications. I'dalso like to talk to people who have to deal with a large number ofincomming messages (e.g. > 20).  I would like to know how they managethe task of reading their mail (old and new) already and what featuresthey would like to see in an mail-sorting expert system.I would greatly appreciate any information, advice or ideas you couldgive me.Thanks,Tim Finin------------------------------------------------------------*start*01338 00024 US Date: 22-Apr-83 10:22 PDTFrom: Yonke.PASubject: a new LafiteTo: Burton, VanMelle, Masinter, Sybalsky, Gadol, Sheilcc: Yonke.PAThere is a new Lafite on Fugue (and Lispusers).  I've been using it for two days and it seems stable.  Aside from some fixes the most notable changes are: -- The menu items are shaded while processing the request.  Since most request now run in separate processes and the long awaited demise of the "NO IO" cursor (which will happen soon thanks to Bill) this feature allows visble feedback to the user that Lafite is doing something. -- Message selection is now continuous with the mouse button down (i.e. the selection(s) change as you move the mouse until you let up on the button).  Also RIGHT-button-extend now shrinks as well as expands. -- The "a" and "f" marks (LAFITEANSWERMARK and LAFITEFORWARDMARK respectively) appear only after successful completion of the message sender (i.e. if you don't send the message (for any reason) the mark will not appear). -- The new mail herald now also includes the time.If you load this on top of a older Lafite, some minor  problems will occur (e.g. it will say "You Have New Mailhh:mm" instead of "You Have New Mail At hh:mm"), but nothing disasterous should happen.  But Lafite should be turned off before the load.Martin*start*00374 00024 US Date: 22-Apr-83 18:07 PDTFrom: BURTON.PASubject: MISC LAFITE glitchesTo: Yonke.PAcc: LispSupport.PALafite-System-Date: 21-Apr-83 16:33 PDTI scrolled the browser window in the middle of a getmail and the browser was confused after that.

In Lafite, this is very tedious, since you have to select in the menu every time.  Would be nice if you could just, say, middle-bug "MoveTo" to put a message in the last chosen file.  The name of said file, of course, would have to be readily visible somewhere.   I have no wonderfully aesthetic solution, but perhaps a browser deserves another line above/below the menu that could contain the default destination file, as well as such status information as now gets printed in the PromptWindow.

I forgot most of the P&V, etc. stuff years ago.   Now it is all coming back since I now have to be a "systems programmer" for real (actually its quite different than dealing with "monitor" type stuff).  I've been trying to screw my head on right about what things to "lock", how to lock, when, etc.  Actually, Interlisp gives one a range of possible implementations that is quite remarkable.All of the above was said so I could say the following -- for now, please be gentle with Lafite (Dick, don't try doing 'Get Mail', 'Update', 'Forward', and 'Display' all at the same time).  I'm rethinking how Lafite should maximally use the process mechanism without without "going south".   There are certainly lessons to be learned -- probably I should write a "white paper" on the pitfalls, opportunities, and new approached to writing user software when I figure it out myself.MartinP.S.:  I don't mean to imply that Lafite has become more unreliable.

The bug happens only if you delete the first message in your file.  So just avoid deleting your first message until Marty thinks this bug is important enough to fix...	Bill
