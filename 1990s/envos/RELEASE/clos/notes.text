Notes on the Medley 2.0 CLOS distribution:1) Yes, this looks a lot like PCL. It's derived from it, with a bunchof bugfixes, modifications for Medley, etc.2) Things that aren't implemented:     generic-labels, generic-flet.     typep integrated with classes. This has to be folded in at the      time that the sysout is created, things break in spectacular ways.      It'll be in Medley 3.0. For now, use CLOS::*TYPEP instead.    structure-class. Again, for this to be efficient it needs to go in      at build time. If you need this critically, send me a message      and I'll see what I can put together.3) A note about the walker. It's based on the walker that's already inMedley, and since it's a tad more efficient, it'll replacecl:walk-form eventually. If you're calling cl:walk-form, you probablywant to transition over to walker:walk-form.4) The MOP that's currently supported is the PCL MOP. As the AMOPdevelops, we'll support it.5) A note on speed. If you've got a class browser open, loading alarge CLOS file is slow. This is because the browser gets updated asthe file is loaded. Close the browser, load the file, then recomputethe browser. Should I put in a switch for this?6) Packages: All the symbols in CLtL2 are in the LISP package, CLOSinternals/MOP are in the CLOS package.7) The documentation for the CLOS system is CLtL2. The documentationfor the Browser is currently being written, but I've put what's doneso far in the directory. Feel free to comment on it.9) To load the system, load the file 'load-clos.lisp', and call thefunction (load-clos &optional pathname). It assumes the pathname fromwhich it was loaded.10) To load the browser, load the files GRAPHER.LCOM,WEB-EDITOR.DFASL, CLOS-BROWSER.DFASL.11) If you've got any comments, bug reports, etc., feel free to sendthem to me, welch@cis.ohio-state.edu.
