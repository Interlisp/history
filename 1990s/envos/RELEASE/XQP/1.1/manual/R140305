ref-14-3-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 14-3-5: abolish(+Name, +Arity)abolish(+Name, +Arity) abolishes the predicate with name Name and arity Arity.That is, Prolog wipes out all the predicate's clauses and all the informationit has about them.  After this command is executed, the program functions as ifthe abolished predicate had never existed.abolish/2 is an obsolete special case of abolis h/1 ({manual(ref-14-3-4)}),retained for backward compatibility with DEC-10 Prolog, C Prolog, and earlierversions of Xerox Quintus Prolog.
