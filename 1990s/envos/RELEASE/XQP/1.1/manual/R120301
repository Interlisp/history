ref-12-3-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                  Section 12-3-1: Trace Mode and Debug ModeThe debugger has two modes of operation:  trace mode and debug mode.  Whiletrace mode is in force, every time you type a goal at the top level, thedebugger starts single-stepping (creeping) immediately.  In contrast, whiledebug mode is in force, the debugger does nothing until a call is made to aprocedure on which you have placed a spypoint.  That is, it starts by leaping.The debugger mode, trace or debug, determines the first procedure call whichwill be traced after a goal is typed at top level.  There is no otherdifference between the two modes.  Whenever the debugger prompts you for input,you have a number of options, including those of creeping (single-stepping) andleaping (jumping to the next spypoint).See trace/0 ({manual(ref-12-6-2)}) and debug/0 ({manual(ref-12-6-1)}) for howto turn the debugger on in trace mode and debug mode respectively.
