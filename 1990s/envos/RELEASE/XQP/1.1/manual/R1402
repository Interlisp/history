ref-14-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                     Section 14-2: assert(+Clause, -Ref)assert(Clause, Ref) is equivalent to assert(Clause) ({manual(ref-13-2-1)}), butreturns in Ref a data base reference which uniquely identifies the newlyasserted Clause.On some systems, it is possible to guess reference numbers so as to instantiateRef to a value that will unify with the value returned by assert/2, but this isnot recommended.  Ref should always be uninstantiated; assert/2 fails if Refdoes not unify with its return value.
