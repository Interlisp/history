sysdep-1-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                      Section 1-1: Initialization FilesWhen Xerox Quintus Prolog is invoked, it normally looks in your login directory(the value of the Lisp variable LOGINHOST/DIR) for a file named prolog.ini, andif it finds one, consults it.  Note that it is not a limitation that theprolog.ini file is consulted rather than compiled.  If there are proceduresthat you want compiled, you can put them in another file, say 'my_procs.pl',and put a directive such as             :- compile(my_procs).in your 'prolog.ini' file.
