sysdep-4-2            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                           Section 4-2: TEdit ModesUnder Xerox Quintus Prolog, TEdit supports two "modes":  Prolog mode and Textmode.  A TEdit window in Text mode is just like a normal TEdit window (see theXerox Lisp Documentation Tools manual).  However, in Prolog mode, TEditprovides several features of great use in developing Prolog code.To bring up a TEdit window, select the "TEdit" option from the main backgroundmenu.  This will give you a TEdit window in the default mode, which isinitially Prolog, but may be changed at any time.  If you wish to get a TEditwindow in the non-default mode, you must use the TEdit submenu.  When selectingthe TEdit option from the main background menu, note the small triangle next tothe TEdit option.  If you move the cursor to the right of this option and outof the window, you will get another menu, from which you may select the modefor the TEdit window to be opened.  You may change the default TEdit mode byselecting the "<change default>" item from this submenu.  You may see what thedefault TEdit mode is by holding down the left mouse button for a moment whilethe cursor is over the "TEdit" background menu item.In Prolog mode, you can select one of the following commands from the TEditmenu:   - Consult or Compile -- These commands enable you to consult or compile     code directly from a TEdit window.  You can load as much or as little     of a buffer as you like by marking the region you want to load and     then consulting or compiling it.   - Find Definition -- This command allows you to find the source code     for a procedure which you have previously consulted or compiled.  The     source of the specified procedure is loaded into a TEdit window.   - Library -- This command enables you to search for a file through a     list of user-defined directories.   - Mode -- This command allows you to change the mode of a TEdit window.     This may be useful for editing large comments in a Prolog file, or if     you decide to edit text instead of Prolog code in a TEdit window.
