If you do usedisjunctions, though, use a consistent layout scheme to improve the readabilityof your program.  For example,bank_open(Day, Time) :-   weekday(Day),           % The bank is open on weekdays   \+ bank_holiday(Day),   % except bank holidays   1000 =< Time,           % from 10 a.m.   (  Time =< 1500,        % until 3 p.m.      \+ friday(Day)       % Monday through Thursday   |  Time =< 1800,        % or 6 p.m.      friday(Day)          % on Fridays   ).All the goals in the disjunction are indented, and the disjunction symbol '|'is prominently placed directly below the opening parenthesis and above theclosing one.  It is best to put the '|' symbol at the beginning of the linecontaining the disjunction.  The indentation style shown in the example abovehelps make the scope of the disjunction explicit.Conditionals that are part of a disjunction are written similarly.  Thedifference is that the test part of the conditional is started right after theopening parenthesis or disjunction symbol that precedes it.  This is shown inthe following example, which computes or tests the type of a character.type_of_character(Ch, Type) :-   (  Ch >= "a", Ch =< "z" ->   % if "a" =< Ch =< "z"      Type = lowercase          % then unify Type and                                        'lowercase'   |  Ch >= "A", Ch =< "Z" ->   % else if "A" =< Ch =< "Z"      Type = uppercase          % then unify Type and                                        'uppercase'   |  Ch >= "0", Ch =< "9" ->   % else if "0" =< Ch =< "9"      Type = digit              % then unify Type and 'digit'   |  otherwise ->              % else      Type = other              % unify Type and 'other'   ).The built-in predicate otherwise/0 is equivalent to true/0; that is, it simplysucceeds without doing anything.  otherwise/0 is provided solely for laying outconditionals in this way.NOTE:  The standard disjunction symbol in Xerox Quintus Prolog is the verticalbar (|), but the semicolon (;) can be used in place of the vertical bar, ifdesired.  The vertical bar should be used whenever possible because it makesyour program layout clearer and easier to read.  Note, however, thathistorically the semicolon has been used as the disjunction symbol; so evenwhen you use the vertical bar, the system automatically translates the symbolinto a semicolon.  Therefore, any printouts of your programs will showsemicolons, even if you used vertical bars.
