ref-5-3-10                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 5-3-10: flush_output(+Stream)flush_output(Stream) sends all data in the output buffer to stream Stream.Output to a stream is not necessarily sent immediately; it is buffered.  Thispredicate flushes the output buffer for the specified stream and thus ensuresthat everything that has been written to the stream is actually sent at thatpoint.If Stream is not a stream object representing an open output stream,flush_output(Stream) fails and sends an error message to the standard errorstream.  The system then enters the debugger in trace mode.There is also a predicate ttyflush/0 ({manual(ref-5-7-7)}) which is equivalentto flush_output(user).
