ref-5-3-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                   Section 5-3-5: open_null_stream(-Stream)open_null_stream(Stream) opens an output stream which is not connected to anyfile and unifies its stream object with Stream.  Characters or terms which aresent to this stream are thrown away.  This predicate is useful because variouspieces of local state are kept for null streams:  the predicatescharacter_count/2, line_count/2, and line_position/2 can be used on thesestreams (see {manual(ref-5-5)}).If Stream is fully instantiated at the time of the call to open_null_stream/1,the call simply fails.  open_null_stream/1 has no associated error conditions.
