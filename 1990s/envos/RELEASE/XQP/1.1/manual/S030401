sysdep-3-4-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual               Section 3-4-1: prolog_flag(gc_trace, -Old, ?New)prolog_flag(gc_trace, Old, New) enables and disables diagnostic tracing ofgarbage collections.  The variables Old and New are used to access or changethe value of gc_trace, and can have the values 'on' or 'off'.  gc_trace is'off' by default.If gc_trace is 'off', garbage collection will not be reported to the user.If gc_trace is 'on', lines of text concerning the start, finish, andperformance of the garbage collector will be written to the standard errorstream.  A typical garbage collection might write to the terminal:[ Garbage Collection of the Heap Stack Started ][      317 : Tracing and Marking Time in Milliseconds ][    38452 : Heap Size in Bytes ][    16420 : Accessible Heap in Bytes ][    22032 : Inaccessible Heap in Bytes ][    57.3% : Percent Garbage ][      400 : Compacting and Relocating Time in Milliseconds ][ Garbage Collection of the Heap Stack Finished ]If Old or New is instantiated to any value other than 'on' or 'off',prolog_flag/3 fails, and an error message is sent to the standard error stream.The system then enters the debugger in trace mode.
