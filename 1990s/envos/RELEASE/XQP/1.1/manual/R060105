ref-6-1-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 6-1-5: display(?X)display(X) displays the term X on the standard output stream (normally thismeans the user's terminal), which is not necessarily the current output stream.Also, display/1 ignores operator declarations and shows all compound terms instandard prefix form.  For example, the command             | ?- display(a+b).produces the following:              +(a,b)display/1 is a good way of finding out how Prolog parses a term with severaloperators.  Note that the output of display/1 is not terminated by a full-stop;therefore, if you want the term to be acceptable as input to read/[1,2], youmust send the terminating full-stop to the output stream yourself.  display/1does not put quotes around atoms and functors.display/1 always succeeds without error.
