The major features of XeroxQuintus Prolog include:   - a fast, efficient implementation   - easy program entry and debugging using the TEdit text editor     interface   - special functions to allow interfacing with existing programs written     in Lisp (see the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependent Features     Manual)   - style warnings and syntax error messages to aid in finding     programming errors before execution (see {manual(user-3-6)}, and     {manual(user-3-7)})   - a comprehensive debugging package for interactive debugging during     program execution (see {manual(user-6)})   - an on-line documentation and help facility:  all Xerox Quintus Prolog     manuals are stored in on-line form, complete with cross-references,     for easy access by topic or by keyword (see {manual(user-2-3)})   - a high degree of compatibility with DEC-10 Prolog and Prolog-20 (see     {manual(user-7)})These features combine to produce a system that fully supports a programmer'sneeds during application development, as well as encouraging the writing ofeasily readable and maintainable programs.
