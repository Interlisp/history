ref-15-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                   Section 15-5: clause(?Head, ?Body, ?Ref)clause(Head, Body, Ref) has two different modes of use, depending on whether ornot the data base reference Ref of the clause is given.  If Ref is specified,then 'Head :- Body' is unified with the clause identified by Ref.  (If thisclause is a unit clause, Body is unified with 'true'.)If Ref is instantiated but is not well-formed, or if Ref is not the referencecorresponding to Head and Body, clause/3 simply fails.  If Head and Body do nothave a reference (for example, if their clause was asserted using assert/1),the call also fails.If Ref is not instantiated, then clause/3 behaves exactly like clause/2({manual(ref-14-4)}) except that the data base reference is returned.
