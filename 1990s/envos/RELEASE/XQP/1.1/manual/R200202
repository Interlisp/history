ref-20-2-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                      Section 20-2-2: Placement of CutsPrograms can often be made more readable by the placing of cuts as early aspossible in clauses.  For example, consider the procedure p/0 defined by             p :- a, b, !, c, d.            p :- e, f.Suppose that b/0 is a test that determines which clause of p/0 applies; a/0 mayor may not be a test, but c/0 and d/0 are not supposed to fail under anycircumstances.  A cut is most appropriately placed after the call to b/0.  Ifin fact a/0 is the test and b/0 is not supposed to fail, then it would be muchclearer to move the cut before the call to b/0.
