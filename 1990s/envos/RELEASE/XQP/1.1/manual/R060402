ref-6-4-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual          Section 6-4-2: Stream-based Input and Output of CharactersThe following predicates are alternatives to the ones described in{manual(ref-6-2)}.  These predicates take an explicit stream argument ratherthan using the current input and output streams.  Opening files and associatingthem with streams is described in {manual(ref-6-3)}.If the stream argument does not specify a valid stream, the predicate willfail, trap to the debugger, and send an error message to the standard errorstream.  If a closed stream is specified, the predicate will fail, and an errormessage will be sent to the standard error stream.get0(S, C)  like get0/1, {manual(ref-6-2-1)}, except that the character is            input from stream S rather than from the current input stream.get(S, C)   like get/1, {manual(ref-6-2-2)}, except that input is taken from            stream S rather than from the current input stream.skip(S, C)  like skip/1, {manual(ref-6-2-3)}, except that input is taken from            stream S rather than from the current input stream.put(S, C)   like put/1, {manual(ref-6-2-4)}, except the character is sent to            stream S rather than to the current output stream.nl(S)       like nl/0, {manual(ref-6-2-5)}, except that the linefeed is sent to            stream S rather than to the current output stream.tab(S, N)   like tab/1, {manual(ref-6-2-6)}, except that the spaces are sent to            stream S rather than to the current output stream.
