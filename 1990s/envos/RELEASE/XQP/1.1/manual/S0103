sysdep-1-3            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                   Section 1-3: Saved States and Xerox LispIf you have have used other versions of Prolog, you are probably familiar withusing saved states to store an executable (consulted or compiled) version of aProlog program.  Under Xerox Lisp, use a SYSOUT instead of a saved state tostore an executable version of a program.  For more information on SYSOUTs,refer to the user's guide for your Xerox workstation.
