ref-12-6-9                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual               Section 12-6-9: unknown(-OldAction, +NewAction)unknown(OldAction, NewAction) unifies OldAction with the current action onunknown procedures, and then sets the current action to NewAction.  This actiondetermines whether or not the interpreter will catch calls to undefinedprocedures and is one of:trace       Undefined procedures will trap to the debuggerfail        Undefined procedures will simply failThe default action is 'trace'.  Note that             | ?- unknown(Action, Action).just returns Action without changing it.Procedures which are known to be dynamic are never trapped by the debugger; itis assumed that these procedures are meant to fail when there are no clausesfor them.  For more information on dynamic procedures, see {manual(ref-14-1)}.If either action is instantiated to any term other than 'trace' or 'fail',unknown/2 simply fails.
