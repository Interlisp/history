ref-4-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 4-0: OverviewThere are two ways of loading programs into Prolog -- consulting and compiling.Consulted code is interpreted, and has the advantages of greater flexibility indebugging.  The advantage of compiling is that the program will runconsiderably faster and use less space during its execution.It is very easy to mix compiled and interpreted code, so it is generally bestto compile code which is well-tested, and consult new, untested code which isbeing added to it.This chapter contains references to the use of the module system.  These can beignored if the module system is not being used (see {manual(ref-13)} forinformation on the module system).
