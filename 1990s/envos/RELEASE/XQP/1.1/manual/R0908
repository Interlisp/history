ref-9-8                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                     Section 9-8: compare(?Op, ?T1, ?T2)compare(Op, T1, T2) succeeds if the result of comparing terms T1 and T2 is Op,where the possible values for Op are:    '='   if T1 is identical to T2,    '<'   if T1 is before T2 in the standard order,    '>'   if T1 is after T2 in the standard order.Thus, the goal            | ?- compare(=, T1, T2).is equivalent to            |?- (T1 == T2).Also, the query             | ?- compare(R, 1, 2).            R = <succeeds, binding R to <, because 1 comes before 2 in the standard order.If Op is supplied, and is not one of '<', '>', or '=', compare/3 simply fails.compare/3 has no associated error conditions.
