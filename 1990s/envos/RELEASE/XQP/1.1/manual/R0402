ref-4-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                             Section 4-2: +P ; +QDisjunction:  (P ; Q) succeeds if P succeeds or Q succeeds.  Again, this isnormally regarded as part of the syntax of the language, but it is like abuilt-in predicate in that you can say call((P ; Q)).  The character '|'(vertical bar) can be used as an alternative to ';'.
