sysdep-6-2-4            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                          Section 6-2-4: manual(+X)This predicate can be used in two different ways.  It is primarily used whenyou know exactly where in the manual you want to look.  The form of a manual/1call is             | ?- manual(SectionNumber).where SectionNumber is in one of the forms            Manual-Chapter-Section-Subsection            Manual-Chapter-Section            Manual-Chapter            ManualManual is either 'user', 'ref', 'sysdep', or 'lib'; and Chapter, Section, andSubsection are integers.  XQPInfo is used to display the specified point in themanual hierarchy.manual/1 can also take a topic as an argument, in which case it will performthe same function as help/1, as described in {manual(sysdep-6-2-2)}.NOTE:  All sections of the on-line manuals are numbered sequentially as thoughthey were chapters; thus, the numbering scheme of the on-line help system maybe different from that of the paper manuals.  This should present nodifficulty.  If there is a need to cross-reference between the paper andon-line manuals, use the names, rather than the numbers, of the sections inquestion.
