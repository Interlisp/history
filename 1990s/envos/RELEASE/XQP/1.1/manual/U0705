user-7-5                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                 Section 7-5: Miscellaneous IncompatibilitiesThe form [X,..Y] is not accepted in Xerox Quintus Prolog as an alternativenotation for [X|Y].  A syntax error message will be displayed if this format isused.The alternative bracket notations of '%(' and '%)' which were allowed asalternatives to '{' and '}' are not allowed.The end-of-file character was 26 (Control-z) in DEC-10 Prolog.  Xerox QuintusProlog returns -1 when an attempt is made to read a character at end-of-file.Also, the character 31 was used for newline in DEC-10 Prolog.  In Xerox QuintusProlog it is 13.  The checker will give you "suspicious number" warningswhenever it encounters a 26 or a 31 in your program.  Of course, it has no wayof knowing when a 26 is actually being used to stand for end-of-file, nor whena 31 is actually being used for newline.  It simply warns you about everyoccurrence of these integers and you should check to see if they really need tobe changed.
