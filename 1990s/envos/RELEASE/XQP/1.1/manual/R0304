ref-3-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual         Section 3-4: Redefining Procedures during Program ExecutionThere is no reason why you cannot redefine procedures during the execution ofthe program, and this can be a very useful thing to do while debugging.  Thenormal way to do this is to use the 'b' option to the debugger to put yourselfinto a break state (see break/0, {manual(ref-10-3)}), and then to load analtered version of some procedures through the editor interface (see the XeroxQuintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual for how to do this).  If you dothis, it is advisable, after redefining the procedures and exiting from thebreak state, to wind the computation back to the first call to any of theprocedures you are changing:  you can do this by using the 'retry' option withan argument which is the invocation number of that call.  If you do not windthe computation back like this, then:   - if you are in the middle of executing a procedure which you redefine,     you will find that the old definition of the procedure continues to     be used until it exits or fails;   - if you should fail back into a procedure you have just redefined,     then alternative clauses in the old definition will still be used.
