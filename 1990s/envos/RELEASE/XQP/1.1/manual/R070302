The goal succeeds if theresults are not equal.  For example,             | ?- 7 =\= 14/2.            no            | ?- 7 =\= 15/2.            yesIf X and Y are not arithmetic expressions, or if X or Y contains variableswhich are not bound to numbers, an error message is sent to the standard errorstream, and the goal fails.
