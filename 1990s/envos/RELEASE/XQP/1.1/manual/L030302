lib-3-3-2                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                   Section 3-3-2: atom_chars(?Atom, ?Chars)Chars is the list of character codes comprising the printed representation ofAtom.  Initially, either Atom must be instantiated to an atom, or Chars must beinstantiated to a proper list of character codes.If Atom is initially instantiated to an atom, Chars is unified with a list ofthe character codes that make up its printed representation.  If Atom isuninstantiated and Chars is initially instantiated to a list of characters,Atom is instantiated to an atom containing exactly those characters, even ifthe characters look like the printed representation of a number.  If thearguments to atom_chars/2 are both uninstantiated, it fails, and an errormessage is sent to the standard error stream.  The system then enters thedebugger in trace mode.atom_chars/2 was built into the system in Release 2.0.  Before that, it was alibrary predicate.  library(strings) still contains the old code under the nameatom_chars1/2.
