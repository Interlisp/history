Again, type 'consult(user).'  atthe top-level prompt (from now on, we will omit <CR>s; assume that each line isto be ended with one).            | ?- consult(user).Now enter the following clauses at the vertical-bar prompt (the continuationlines of the rule will be indented automatically and will not be preceded by avertical bar).  If you make a mistake typing one of the clauses, you can fix itusing standard TExec commands.            | drive_to_work(Day) :-                 it_is_cold(Day),                 it_is_raining(Day).            |            | it_is_cold(monday).            | it_is_cold(tuesday).            | it_is_cold(wednesday).            | it_is_cold(thursday).            |            | it_is_raining(tuesday).            | it_is_raining(wednesday).            | it_is_raining(friday).            | end_of_file.            [user consulted 0.400 sec 1036 bytes]            | ?-Now, if you type            | ?- it_is_cold(Day).the system will respond            Day = mondayNow you can direct the system to backtrack and tell you all of the cold days byresponding to each system output line with a semicolon:            Day = monday ;            Day = tuesday ;            Day = wednesday ;            Day = thursday ;            no            | ?-To find out the days on which you should drive to work, type            | ?- drive_to_work(AnyDay).            AnyDay = tuesday ;            AnyDay = wednesday ;            no            | ?-
