ref-6-2-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 6-2-2: get(-N)get(N) unifies N with the ASCII code of the next non-layout character from thecurrent input stream.  Layout characters are all outside the inclusive range33..126; this includes space, tab, linefeed, DEL, and all control characters.If there are no more non-layout characters in the stream, N is unified with -1.If the end of the stream was reached on a previous input command, then get/1will send an error message to the standard error stream and call abort/0,returning to the top level.
