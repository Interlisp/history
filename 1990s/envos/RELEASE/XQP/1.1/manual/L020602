lib-2-6-2                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                  Section 2-6-2: Predicates Related to SetsThe following predicates are relevant to sets, but are not in library(sets):length(?Set, ?Cardinality)            built-in predicate:  do not use this if Set might contain            duplicates.  See the Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual for more            information.append(?Set1, ?Set2, ?Union)            in library(basics) ({manual(lib-2-4-1)}):  only use append/3 this            way when Set1 and Set2 are known to be disjoint, and put a comment            in your code explaining the hack.member(?Elem, ?Set)            in library(basics) ({manual(lib-2-4-2)})memberchk(?Elem, ?Set)            in library(basics) ({manual(lib-2-4-3)})subseq0(+Set, ?SubSet)            in library(lists) ({manual(lib-2-5)}):  you can only use subseq0/2            to generate subsets of a given Set, not to test whether a given            SubSet is a subset of a given Set, because subseq0/2 preserves the            order of the elements, which is irrelevant to sets.  However, you            can use it to generate subsets of an ordered set, as the order of            the elements does matter there.subseq1(+Set, ?ProperSubSet)            in library(lists) ({manual(lib-2-5)}):  you can only use subseq1/2            to generate proper subsets of a given Set, not to test whether a            given SubSet is a proper subset of a given Set, because subseq1/2            preserves the order of the elements, which is irrelevant to sets.            However, you can use it to generate proper subsets of an ordered            set, as the order of the elements does matter there.
