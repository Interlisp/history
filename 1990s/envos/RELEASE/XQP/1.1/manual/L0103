lib-1-3                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                  Section 1-3: Four List Processing PackagesThere are four library files which are specifically concerned with listprocessing.  They arelibrary(basics)            contains very basic list processing operations.library(lists)            contains operations which view lists as sequences.library(sets)            contains operations which view lists as sets.library(ordsets)            contains operations which view lists as sets, but require that the            elements of the lists be in standard order (see compare/3 in the            Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual) so as to be much more            efficient than library(sets) for any but the smallest sets.As a general rule, if a predicate defined here has a counter (a non-negativeinteger) as one of its arguments, it will suffice for the counter argument tobe instantiated.  Otherwise, at least one of the list arguments must be aproper list.  Failing this, the predicate may backtrack forever trying everlonger lists.  When you look at the code you will see that some of the libraryroutines use same_length/2 or same_length/3 to ensure termination.
