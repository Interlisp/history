ref-10-6                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                         Section 10-6: subgoal_of(?S)subgoal_of(S) is equivalent to the following sequence of goals:              ancestors(Goals), member(S, Goals).where Goals is a list.  The predicate member/2 (from the Quintus Prologlibrary) successively matches its first argument with each of the elements ofthe list Goals.  It may be defined by             member(X, [X|_]).            member(X, [_|L]) :- member(X, L).If S is instantiated and is not an ancestor goal of the current clause,subgoal_of(S) simply fails.
