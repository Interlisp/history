user-0-3                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                     Section 0-3: Symbols and ConventionsThroughout this manual, certain symbols and conventions are used.   - Boldface type is used to indicate user responses in examples that     show interactions between a user and Prolog.  For instance, in the     example below, the system prompts and output are shown in regular     type, and the user input is shown in boldface.                 | ?- X is 2+2.                 X = 4 <CR>                 | ?-   - Italicized words in examples indicate the type of information that     should appear in a particular position.  For instance, in the example     below, the term filename would be replaced by an actual file name.                 | ?- consult(filename).   - Since different Lisp listeners have different default prompts, the     symbol <prompt> is used in examples to represent the main Lisp     prompt.   - Built-in predicate names are written in boldfaced type, followed by     their arities, as in write/1 or consult/1.   - Prominent occurrences of words and phrases whose definitions appear     in the glossary are highlighted by boldfaced type.   - The symbol <CR> is used in examples to represent a carriage return     typed by the user.  This key is usually marked by an arrow pointing     down and to the left, and is referred to as 'Return' or 'the Return     key' in running text.   - Control characters are represented in text by the notation Control-x,     where  x represents the character you type while holding down the     Control key.  In examples, control characters are represented by the     notation  ^x.   - Type Control-z to send an end-of-file character to Prolog.     (Control-z is the default end-of-file character at most sites;     however, the end-of-file character for your site may be different.)     In place of any of these, you can usually type 'end_of_file.' to     avoid any site-to-site variations.
