user-4-1                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                        Section 4-1: Asking QuestionsSuppose your program contained the following clauses:              parts_of(transmission, gears).            parts_of(transmission, housing).            parts_of(transmission, shaft).You could ask the question "Are gears part of the transmission?" by typing            | ?- parts_of(transmission, gears).Prolog would attempt to satisfy this goal; and if it succeeded, it woulddisplay the word 'yes' and then redisplay the main Prolog prompt, as shownbelow.            | ?- parts_of(transmission, gears).            yes            | ?-If Prolog had not found clauses to satisfy the goal, it would display the word'no' and then redisplay the main Prolog prompt.              | ?- parts_of(transmission, brakes).            no            | ?-NOTE:  A question in Prolog is also known as a query.  Like clauses andcommands, queries must end with a full-stop.As with Prolog clauses, you can use variables in place of constants in yourqueries.  For example, to ask the question "What are the parts of thetransmission?" you could type             | ?- parts_of(transmission, X).            X = gearsProlog displays the first valid value it finds for X, as shown above.If the first value is sufficient -- that is, if you don't want Prolog tocontinue searching for other answers -- press the Return key.  Prolog thenreturns you to the main Prolog prompt.              | ?- parts_of(transmission, X).            X = gears <CR>            | ?-If you want Prolog to continue searching for valid answers, type a semicolon(;) and press the Return key.  (Recall that in Prolog, a semicolon means or.So by typing a semicolon, you direct Prolog to search for an alternativeanswer.)  For example, to see if the transmission contains any parts other thangears, you would type a semicolon after Prolog displayed the first answer.              | ?- parts_of(transmission, X).            X = gears ;            X = housingYou can request as many additional answers as you like by typing a semicoloneach time Prolog displays an answer. Prolog will continue to search foradditional answers until it reaches the last valid answer in your program.  Ifyou type a semicolon and there are no more valid answers, Prolog simplydisplays the word 'no' and returns to the main Prolog prompt, as shown below.              | ?- parts_of(transmission, X).            X = gears ;            X = housing ;            X = shaft ;            no            | ?-Remember that a query must be terminated by a full-stop.  If this is omitted,the system will assume that the query is incomplete and will indent the cursor5 spaces, thus:              | ?- parts_of(X, Y)                 _If this happens, type the period on the new line, followed by another Return.NOTE:  Prolog runs under TExec, so you can scroll backward and forward throughyour Prolog session.
