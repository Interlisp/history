sysdep-3-3-0            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                         Section 3-3-0: IntroductionThe user has the option of executing programs with or without garbagecollection.  Procedures that do not use a large amount of heap space beforebacktracking may not be affected when garbage collection is enabled.Procedures that do use a large amount of heap space may execute more slowly dueto the time spent garbage collecting, but will be more likely to run tocompletion.  On the other hand, such programs may run faster when the garbagecollector is enabled because the virtual memory is not expanded to the extentthat "thrashing" occurs.
