ref-17-4-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 17-4-1: expand_term(+T1, -T2)expand_term(T1, T2) transforms some of the terms in a program before they arecompiled (or consulted and stored as interpreted clauses).  expand_term/2 isusually called by the built-in predicates compile/1 and consult/1, and notdirectly by user programs.The normal use of expand_term(T1, T2) is to translate grammar rules intoordinary Prolog clauses.  If T1 is a grammar rule, then T2 is the correspondingclause.  Otherwise T2 is simply T1 unchanged.  For example,            | ?- expand_term((a-->b), T).            T = a(_154,_152):-b(_154,_152)If T1 is not of the proper form, or if T2 does not unify with its clausal form,expand_term/2 simply fails.The user may define other transformations to be done by expand_term/2 bydefining clauses for term_expansion/2.  expand_term/2 calls term_expansion/2first; if it succeeds, the standard grammar rule expansion is not tried.expand_term/2 always calls term_expansion/2 in module 'user'.  Therefore, to bevisible to expand_term/2, term_expansion/2 must either be defined in orimported into module 'user'.
