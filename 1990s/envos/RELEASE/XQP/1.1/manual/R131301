ref-13-13-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                     Section 13-13-1: current_module(Mod)The built-in predicate current_module/1 allows you to check whether a module is"current" or to backtrack through all of the current modules.  A module becomescurrent as soon as some predicate is defined in it, and a module can never losethe property of being current.  The following command will print out allcurrent modules:| ?- current_module(Module), writeq(Module), nl, fail.current_module/1 succeeds even if Module has no associated file.  If itsargument is not correct, current_module/1 simply fails.
