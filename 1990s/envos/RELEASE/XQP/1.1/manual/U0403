Thiscan be particularly helpful if you want to locate the source code for aprocedure that is called by another procedure from a different file.NOTE:  For this command to work, the procedure being looked for must be loadedinto Prolog.To locate a procedure that is being called by another procedure, select anycharacter in the name of the predicate whose definition you want to locate.  Itis not necessary to select the entire name.Next, select the Find Definition option of the TEdit menu.  On the top line ofthe Prolog window, TEdit displays a message telling you to press the Return keyto locate the procedure you selected, or to type the name and arity of theprocedure you want to locate.  For example, if you positioned the cursor nextto the procedure sort(L, S), and then selected the Find Definition option, thesystem would display the message            <return> to find <sort/2> or enter name/arity =To find the procedure you requested, press the Return key.  To find anotherprocedure, type the name and arity of that procedure in the form name/arity.For example, to locate the procedure for employee(smith, harold), you wouldtype 'employee/2', as shown below.              name/arity = employee/2 <CR>NOTE:  You can type the predicate name without typing the arity, and the systemwill still locate the predicate.  If the predicate was defined for more thanone arity, the system will simply locate one of the definitions of thepredicate.If you position the cursor next to a procedure, select the Find Definitionoption, and then press the Return key, Prolog locates the file the procedurewas loaded from, opens a TEdit window on that file, and positions the proceduredefinition so that it is visible.  If the file was already being viewed in anexisting window, then that window is used; otherwise, TEdit prompts you for thelocation of a new TEdit window and then uses that window to display the file.If Prolog cannot find a procedure of the specified name and arity, it displaysa message telling you the procedure is undefined:              foo/2 is undefined
