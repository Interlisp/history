sysdep-6-2-2            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                         Section 6-2-2: help(+Topic)This is the basic help command.  It attempts to accept any argument you give itas a topic for which help may exist in the manual.  The argument is convertedinto a character string, and all the index entries which start with that stringare combined into a menu which gives you a choice of entry points into themanual hierarchy.  This is identical to using the Lookup! menu entry in theXQPInfo system as described in {manual(sysdep-6-1)}.It is not necessary to type the whole of the word which is the Topic you wantinformation about.  However, the fewer characters you type, the larger the menuis likely to be, because more index entries will begin with that charactersequence.  Thus,             | ?- help(d).will give you a menu of all index entries beginning with the letter 'd', while             | ?- help('debug').will give you a menu of all the index entries which start with the word'debug'.  You can even type             | ?- help('').(the null atom) to get a menu of the entire index!
