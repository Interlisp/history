ref-5-7                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 5-7: +P -> +QWhen occurring other than as the first argument of a disjunction operator (| or;), this is equivalent to            P -> Q | fail.(For a definition of P -> Q | R, see {manual(ref-5-6)}.)  '->'/2 cuts away anychoice points in the execution of P, and it may be thought of as a "local cut".Note that the operator precedence of '->'/2 is greater than 1000, so itdominates commas.  Thus, in            f :- p, q -> r, s.            f.'->'/2 cuts away any choices in p or in q, but unlike cut (!)  it does not cutaway the alternative choice for f.
