lib-2-6                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                     Section 2-6: Note on Argument OrderAll the predicates in library(occurs) have the same argument pattern:{prefix}_{term|var}(SubTerm, Term[, Extra])where Extra includes any other arguments.  Why does the SubTerm argument appearfirst?  The answer involves library(call) and library(maplist).  Here are someof the things you can do with the arguments this way around:terms_containing_term(SubTerm, Terms, Selected) :-        include(contains_term(SubTerm), Terms, Selected).    %   if member(Term, Terms), then Term will be included in    %   Selected iff contains_term(SubTerm, Term) succeeds.terms_free_of_var(SubTerm, Terms, Selected) :-        exclude(contains_var(SubTerm), Terms, Selected).    %   if member(Term, Terms), then Term will be included in    %   Selected iff contains_var(SubTerm, Term) fails.tallies_of_term(SubTerm, Terms, Tallies) :-        maplist(occurrences_of_term(SubTerm), Terms, Tallies).    %   if nth1(N, Terms, Term), then nth1(N, Tally, Tallies)    %   where occurrences_of_term(SubTerm, Term, Tally).The same argument order is used for sub_term/2 even though it is not used inthis way, in order to preserve consistency.
