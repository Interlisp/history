ref-13-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                      Section 13-4: clause(+Head, ?Body)clause(Head, Body) searches the data base for a clause whose head matches Headand whose body matches Body.  This predicate is non-determinate:  it can beused to backtrack through all the clauses matching a given Head and Body.  Itfails when there are no (or no further) matching clauses in the data base.For the purpose of this matching, unit clauses (clauses with no body) aretreated as if they had a body consisting of the single goal 'true'.  Forexample,             | ?- asserta(foo(a)).            yes            | ?- clause(foo(X),Body).            X = a,            Body = trueHead must be instantiated to a term whose principal functor is a dynamicpredicate.  If Head is an illegal clause head, then an error message is sent tothe standard error stream and clause/2 fails.  If the principal functor of Headis a static predicate, clause/2 fails, an error message is sent to the standarderror stream, and the system enters the debugger in trace mode.  If thepredicate did not previously exist, then it is created as a dynamic predicateand clause/2 fails.
