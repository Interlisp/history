user-4-9                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                             Section 4-9: PromptsThe prompt '|: ' is displayed instead of the '| ?- ' prompt if you type acommand that requires input from the terminal or if your program contains acommand that requires input from the terminal.  For information on changing the'|: ' prompt, refer to the definition of prompt/2 in the Xerox Quintus PrologReference Manual.The '| ' prompt is a modified version of the Prolog top-level prompt. Thisprompt is displayed at the beginning of lines when you type '[user].' or'compile(user).' to enter procedures directly into Prolog.If you are typing a term at any Prolog prompt, and your input is longer thanone line, all lines after the first one are indented five spaces.
