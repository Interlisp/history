The guide includes a tutorial introduction to Prolog,plus information on entering and exiting Prolog, loading and running programs,debugging programs, and designing your programs for maximum readability andreliability.The appendices to this manual include information on porting programsoriginally written in DEC-10 Prolog or Prolog-20 to the Xerox Quintus Prologsystem, and a glossary.The Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual contains complete descriptions of thepredicates available in Xerox Quintus Prolog, including in-depth information onthe operations of these predicates and the error conditions associated withthem.  Also, more comprehensive descriptions of the syntax and semantics ofXerox Quintus Prolog, and so on, are to be found there.  Also included is alist of all the predicates available in Xerox Quintus Prolog.The Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual contains completedescriptions of those predicates and features which are specific to yourparticular implementation of Xerox Quintus Prolog.  Included in this manual aresuch machine-dependent items as memory management.The Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual contains documentation of the library.This contains additional predicates that can be regarded as extensions to theset of predicates that are built into the Prolog system.The Release Note contains announcements of new Xerox Quintus Prolog predicates,bug fixes, and other recent developments.
