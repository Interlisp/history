ref-5-7-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 5-7-4: ttyput(+N)ttyput(N) displays the ASCII character code of N on the terminal.  N may be aninteger expression. The most useful form of integer expression in this contextis a single character in double quotes, for example, "a" which evaluates to 97,the ASCII code for the letter 'a'.Note that the character is not necessarily displayed immediately; seettyflush/0, {manual(ref-5-7-7)}.  If N is not a valid arithmetic expression,ttyput(N) fails, and an error message is sent to the standard error stream.  IfN is an unbound variable, ttyput(N) fails, and an error messageis sent to thestandard error stream.  The system then enters the debugger in trace mode.
