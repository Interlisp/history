If no program ever runs out of space and no program using a lot ofheap space requires an inordinate amount of processing time, then suchinformation is unlikely to be needed.However, if a program thought to be using much heap space runs out of space orruns inordinately slowly, the user may want to determine whether more or lessfrequent garbage collections are necessary.  Information obtained from thegarbage collector can be helpful in this determination.
