ref-15-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                  Section 15-3: recorded(?Key, ?Term, ?Ref)recorded(Key, Term, Ref) searches the internal data base for a term recordedunder the key Key which unifies with Term, and whose data base referenceunifies with Ref.This predicate is nondeterminate, meaning that it can be used to backtrackthrough all the matching terms recorded under the specified key.  Therefore, ifyou want to match only a single term you should use a cut to preventbacktracking.If Ref is instantiated, then Key and Term are unified with the key and termassociated with Ref.  Otherwise, If Key is a compound term, only its principalfunctor is significant.  That is, foo(1) represents the same key as foo(n).A call to recorded/3 of the form (-, ?, +) will succeed if the expectedrelation holds.  Key need not be instantiated.  If Key is a float, recorded/3fails, and an error message is sent to the standard error stream.  The systemthen enters the debugger in trace mode.
