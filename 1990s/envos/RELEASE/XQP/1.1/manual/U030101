user-3-1-1                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                  Section 3-1-1: Using TEdit -- An OverviewTEdit is a menu-driven, window-based text editor that runs under Lisp.  WithTEdit, you can create multiple text windows and move freely among them.To bring up the main background menu, move the mouse until the cursor(represented by a small arrow) is in the background area of the screen.  Thenhold down the right mouse button.  The main background menu will appear.To select an option, move the cursor until the menu option you want to selectis highlighted.  Then release the button.To create a TEdit window in which to enter text, select the TEdit option fromthe main background menu.  The system prompts you for the location of thewindow.  Hold down the left button and move the cursor until the window is theshape you want.  Release the button.  You can then enter new text in thiswindow or you can retrieve an existing file by selecting the Get or Includeoption of the TEdit menu.To move from one window to another, press the left mouse button when the mousecursor is in the window into which you want to type.NOTE:  You can have multiple TEdit windows and one Prolog window open at thesame time.  To open another TEdit window, move the cursor into the backgroundarea again and select the TEdit option from the main background menu.To select an option from the TEdit menu, move the mouse until the cursor ispositioned within the black title bar at the top of the window.  Hold down theleft mouse button to bring up the the TEdit option menu.  To select an option,move the cursor (while holding down the left button) until the option you wantis highlighted.  Then release the button.To close a TEdit window, move the cursor into the title bar and hold down theright mouse button.  Select the Close option of the TEdit menu.For more information on using TEdit, refer to the Xerox TEdit documentation andto your workstation guide.
