sysdep-1-5            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual              Section 1-5: Other Limits in Xerox Quintus PrologAtoms cannot have more than 256 characters.Functors and predicates cannot have arities greater than 255.There are no limits (apart from memory space) on the number of procedures andclauses allowed.The size of a compiled clause is limited to 2^17 bytes of compiled code.There are internal limits on the size of compiled clauses which are difficultto relate to properties visible to the user.  These are 256 "temporaryvariables" (which only occur in the head goal), and 255 "permanent variables"(non-temporaries, which occur in goals in the body).  The compiler willgenerate warnings if these limits are exceeded.  There is no limit on thenumber of "symbols" (variables, atoms, numbers, or functors) in a compiledclause.There are no restrictions on the number of variables or symbols in dynamic orinterpreted clauses.Prolog has a limit of twenty input/output streams that can be open at any onetime.  Three of these streams are reserved for standard input, standard output,and error output respectively.  These three streams are always open.  Standardinput and output normally refer to your terminal, but can be redirected fromwithin Prolog.  The error stream always refers to the terminal.There are no general limits on the amount of space that can be used for any ofthe Prolog data areas, apart from the amount of virtual memory made availableby the operating system.  Prolog expands and contracts its data areas asnecessary.
