user-3-5                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                  Section 3-5: Defining Procedures DirectlyIf you want to define Prolog procedures directly without first typingf theminto a file, you can easily do so.  Note, however, that the Prolog window doesnot provide any editing capability other than that provided by TExec; so inmost cases, you will find it easier to create a TEdit window, enter clausesthere, and then use the Consult or Compile option of the TEdit menu to load theclauses into Prolog.To enter a procedure directly into the data base through the interpreter, typeeither '[user].' or 'consult(user).' at the main Prolog prompt.              | ?- [user].or             | ?- consult(user).Note that in either case the command must be followed by a full-stop.  Type allthe clauses for the procedures you want to enter.  When you are finished, type'end_of_file.' or your end-of-file character to return to the main Prologprompt.After you type 'end_of_file.' or your end-of-file character, the systemdisplays a message telling you that it has consulted your clauses, and how longit took to consult them.  A sample session might look like this:            | ?- consult(user).            | parts_of(transmission, gears).            | parts_of(transmission, housing).            | parts_of(transmission, shaft).            | end_of_file.            [user consulted (1.492 sec)]            yes            | ?-Note that when you type 'end_of_file.' here, it does not halt your Prologsession, as it would if you typed it at the Prolog top-level prompt.Note also that when you type 'consult(user).', the system displays a '|' promptat the beginning of each clause that follows the line on which you typed'consult(user).'  Continuing lines of individual clauses are preceded by fivespaces.  When you finish typing in your procedures and type 'end-of-file.', themain Prolog prompt '| ?- ' returns.To enter a procedure directly into the data base through the compiler, type'compile(user).' at the main Prolog prompt.              | ?- compile(user).Clauses can now be entered directly in exactly the same way as forconsult(user).NOTE:  When you define a procedure directly, the procedure replaces anyprocedures of the same name that were previously defined in the data baseunless those procedures were declared multifile.
