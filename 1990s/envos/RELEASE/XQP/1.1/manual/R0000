ref-0-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 0-0: OverviewThe purpose of this reference manual is to provide, together with the XeroxQuintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual, a complete description of theXerox Quintus Prolog system.  You do not need to read the entire referencemanual before starting to use Xerox Quintus Prolog.  On the contrary, it isorganized so that you should be able to dip into it quickly to find outwhatever you need to know about the system.  For an introduction to Prolog, seethe tutorial chapter of the Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide.The syntax and semantics of Xerox Quintus Prolog are described in{manual(ref-1)} and {manual(ref-2)}.  The remaining chapters describe all thebuilt-in predicates.  These are divided into chapters on the basis of the kindsof functions they perform.  Of particular interest, if you are reading thismanual, is the chapter on the on-line help system in the Xerox Quintus PrologSystem-dependent Features Manual.  This allows you to access the manualdirectly from Prolog whenever you need to look something up.
