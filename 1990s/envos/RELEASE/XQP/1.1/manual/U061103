user-6-11-3                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide               Section 6-11-3: Using the Skip and Retry OptionsThis trace follows the execution of the same procedure as the one shown on thepreceding page; however, here a slightly different and more efficient method oftracing is used.  Rather than tracing every step in the execution of theprogram, a skip is done at selected points.  If a procedure succeeds, we moveon to the next step in the trace; however, if a procedure fails, we do a retryof the procedure and then exhaustively trace the execution of the procedure.This method of debugging is often more efficient because it can help youquickly pinpoint the procedures that are failing; you can then trace thoseprocedures in detail rather than exhaustively tracing all the procedures in theexecution of the program.Note that the procedure call to one_step/1 fails (see the line beginning with'> (17)'); this failure is legitimate, as there is no direct flight from LosAngeles to Seattle on Monday.  The '>' symbol at the beginning of the linesimply signifies the completion of a skip command.After the error is found, 'a' is typed to abort the execution of the program.The error is then corrected (the last clause of connects(Flight1, Flight2) ischanged to "Start2 > End1."), and the procedure connects/2 is reloaded throughthe TEdit interface.  However, the program still doesn't work.| ?- spy [travel_ok,connects]. <CR>[The debugger will first leap -- showing spypoints (debug)][Spypoint placed on travel_ok/3][Spypoint placed on connects/2]yes| ?- meet_on(When). <CR>** (3) 2 Call: travel_ok(_83,san_francisco,seattle) ? l <CR>** (3) 2 Exit: travel_ok(monday,san_francisco,seattle) ? l <CR>** (7) 3 Call: travel_ok(monday,los_angeles,seattle) ? l <CR>** (13) 5 Call: connects(u100,u101) ? <CR>   (14) 6 Call: flight_time(u100,_514,_515) ? <CR>   (14) 6 Exit: flight_time(u100,800,900) ? <CR>   (15) 6 Call: flight_time(u101,_524,_525) ? <CR>   (15) 6 Exit: flight_time(u101,1000,1200) ? <CR>   (16) 6 Call (built-in): 1000>900 ? <CR>   (16) 6 Exit (built-in): 1000>900 ? <CR>** (13) 5 Exit: connects(u100,u101) ? - <CR>[Spypoint removed from connects/2]   (13) 5 Exit: connects(u100,u101) ? l <CR>** (7) 3 Exit: travel_ok(monday,los_angeles,seattle) ? l <CR>** (18) 4 Call: travel_ok(monday,seattle,seattle) ? l <CR>** (18) 4 Fail: travel_ok(monday,seattle,seattle) ? a <CR>[ Execution aborted ]| ?- {select travel_ok/3 and load it into Prolog      by selecting the Consult option from the TEdit menu}[consulting procedure travel_ok/3][consultation completed 0.434 sec 48 bytes]yes| ?- meet_on(When). <CR>** (3) 2 Call: travel_ok(_744,san_francisco,seattle) ? l <CR>** (3) 2 Exit: travel_ok(monday,san_francisco,seattle) ? l <CR>** (7) 3 Call: travel_ok(monday,los_angeles,seattle) ? l <CR>** (7) 3 Exit: travel_ok(monday,los_angeles,seattle) ? l <CR>** (18) 4 Call: travel_ok(monday,seattle,seattle) ? l <CR>** (18) 4 Exit: travel_ok(monday,seattle,seattle) ? l <CR>When = monday
