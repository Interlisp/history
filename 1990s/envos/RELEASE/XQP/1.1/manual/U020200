For example, you could type the 'write' command as shown below; thesystem would execute the command and then return to the top-level Prologprompt.            | ?- write(hello).            hello            yes            | ?-Similarly, you could pose an arithmetic query.            | ?- X is 2+2.            X = 4<CR>            | ?-or load a file using the command            | ?- consult('myfile.pl').<CR><CR> stands for the Return key on your terminal.When your Prolog programs have been loaded (see {manual(user-3)}), queries andcommands referring to your programs can also be given.
