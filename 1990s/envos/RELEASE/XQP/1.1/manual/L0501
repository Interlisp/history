lib-5-1                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                 Section 5-1: Introduction -- library(files)The package library(files) provides operations on individual files, such asrenaming, deleting, opening, and checking for existence.Xerox Lisp provides a generic interface to several different file systems, seeInterlisp-D Reference Manual for details.  Some of the operations it supportsare not available in some file systems.  For example, most file attributes arenot available through TCP/IP.  Conversely, it does not support all theoperations available in every file system.  For example, it does not provide anoperation for creating symbolic links (and the TCP/IP package is confused bythem).  It is very useful to have a generic interface like this, but there aresome disadvantages.Compared with the implementation of library(files) in other single-file-systemenvironments, the implementation of library(files) on top of Xerox Lisp'sgeneric interface has two disadvantages:   - it is hard to diagnose the cause of a failure file-system operation,     so you are told 'A file-system goal failed' rather than being told     more precisely what went wrong.   - file protection, even when available (there is no way of protecting     files on the local disc), cannot be inspected or set.
