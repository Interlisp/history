The concept of predicate logic which is mostimportant here is the concept of logical inference.  Logical inference allowsus, given the fact (or premise)            Aand the rule of inference            if A then Bto deduce the fact (or conclusion)            BFacts and rules of inference together are referred to as clauses.  In general,both A and B can be either a single clause or a group of clauses.            A            B            C            if A and B and C                then D and EThe constructs of Prolog model a small but powerful subset of first-order logicclauses; these clauses are called Horn clauses.
