ref-1-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 1-3: Character EscapingA facility has been added to Xerox Quintus Prolog which allows escape sequencesto occur within strings and quoted atoms.  This facility can be switched on bythe command             | ?- prolog_flag(character_escapes, _, on).and switched off by the command             | ?- prolog_flag(character_escapes, _, off).See {manual(ref-18-3)}, for a description of prolog_flag/3.  Character escapingis off by default.Strings or quoted atoms containing the following escape sequences can occur interms obtained by read/[1,2], consult/1, compile/1, and so on.The 0' notation for the integer code of a character is also affected bycharacter escaping.With character escaping turned on, the only things that can occur in a stringor quoted atom are the characters with ASCII codes 9 (horizontal tab), 32(space), 33 through 126 (non-layout characters), or one of the following escapesequences:The escape sequence:                Is converted to:\b                  backspace       (ASCII 8)\t                  horizontal tab  (ASCII 9)\n                  new line        (ASCII 10)                    (ASCII 13 for Xerox Quintus Prolog systems)\v                  vertical tab    (ASCII 11)\f                  form feed       (ASCII 12)\r                  carriage return (ASCII 13)\e                  ESC             (ASCII 27)\d                  delete          (ASCII 127)\<octal string>     the ASCII character with code <octal string> base 8, where                    <octal string> is either 1, 2, or 3 octal digits\^<control char>    the ASCII character whose code is the ASCII code of                    <control char> mod 32.  |^? is another name for \d.\<layout char>      no character, where <layout char> is a character with ASCII                    code =< 32 or ASCII code >= 127 (thus a newline or                    form-feed in a string or quoted atom can be ignored by                    immediately preceding it with a backslash)\c                  no character; also, all characters up to, but not                    including, the next non-layout character are ignored\<other>            the character <other>, where <other> is any character not                    predefined here; thus '\\' should be used to insert one                    backslashread/[1,2] will signal an error if an escape sequence or ASCII character whichis not defined above occurs in a string or quoted atom.With character escaping turned on, the escape sequence (\') represents the samecharacter as the sequence ('') within a quoted atom, namely one single quote.Similarly, with character escaping turned on, the escape sequence (\")represents the same character as the sequence ("") within a string, namely onedouble quote.The escape sequence '\c' (c for continue) is useful when formatting a stringfor readability.  For example,             | ?- write('!Ruth \c                         Gehrig \c                         Cobb \c                         Williams!').will write             !Ruth Gehrig Cobb Williams!to the current output stream, and            | ?- write(0'\t)will write            9to the current output stream.Depending upon whether character escaping is on or off, writeq/[1,2] andwrite_canonical/[1,2] behave differently when writing quoted atoms.  Ifcharacter escaping is on:     1. The characters with ASCII codes 9 (horizontal tab), 32 (space), and      33 through 126 (non-layout characters) are written as themselves.   2. The characters with ASCII codes 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 27, and 127 are      written in their '\<lowercase letter>' form (see above for the      corresponding letter).   3. The character with ASCII code 39 (single quote) is written as two      consecutive single quotes.   4. The character with ASCII code 92 (back slash) is written as two      consecutive back slashes.   5. All other characters are written in their '\^<control char>' form.  If character escaping is off:     1. The character with ASCII code 39 (single quote) is written as two      consecutive single quotes.   2. All other characters are written as themselves.
