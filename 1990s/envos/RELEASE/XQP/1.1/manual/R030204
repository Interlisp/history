ref-3-2-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual              Section 3-2-4: use_module(+FileSpec, +ImportList)use_module(FileSpec, ImportList) imports the predicates in the list ImportListfrom module-file FileSpec.If the specified module-file has not previously been loaded, it is compiledunless the use_module/2 goal is embedded in a file which is being consulted, inwhich case it is consulted instead.  If FileSpec is not a valid filespecification for a module-file, use_module/2 sends an error message to thestandard error stream, then succeeds with no other effect.After loading the module-file, the source module will attempt to import all thepredicates in ImportList.  ImportList must be a list of predicatespecifications in Name/Arity form.  If any of the predicates in Importlist arenot public predicates, an error message is printed, but the predicates areimported nonetheless.  This lack of strictness is for convenience; if youforget to declare a predicate to be public, you can supply the necessarydeclaration and reload its module, without having to reload the module that hasimported the predicate.It is possible that not all the predicates in the import list will be imported;a name clash may prevent the importation of a predicate.While use_module/1 may be more convenient at the top level, use_module/2 isrecommended in files because it helps document the interface between modules bymaking the list of imported predicates explicit.
