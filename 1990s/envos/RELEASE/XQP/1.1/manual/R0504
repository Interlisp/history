ref-5-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 5-4: call(+X)If X is instantiated to an atom or compound term, then the goal call(X) isexecuted exactly as if that term appeared textually in its place, except thatany cut (!) occurring in X only cuts alternatives in the execution of X.  ForDEC-10 Prolog compatibility, incore/1 is accepted as a synonym for call/1.If X is not instantiated to an atom or a compound term, call/1 fails and sendsan error message to the standard error stream.
