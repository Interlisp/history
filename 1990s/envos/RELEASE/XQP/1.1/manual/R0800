ref-8-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 8-0: IntroductionThe following predicates are used to compare and order terms, rather than toevaluate or process them.  For example, these predicates can be used to comparevariables; however, they never instantiate those variables.  These predicatesshould not be confused with the arithmetic comparison predicates (see{manual(ref-6-3)}) or with unification.
