ref-4-3-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 4-3-0: OverviewBy default, as Xerox Quintus Prolog consults or compiles, it prints warningsabout   1. single occurrences of a named variable in a clause, where "named" in      this context means that the variable name does not begin with an      underscore (_);   2. procedures for which all the clauses are not adjacent (contiguous)      in the source file;   3. procedures for which clauses are encountered in more than one file      (multiple definitions) and which are not declared multifile.  In      DEC-10 Prolog it is possible to spread the definition of a procedure      across more than one file if you use consult/1, but not if you use      compile/1 or reconsult/1.  This style warning can be useful in      catching any attempt to do this.These warnings can be very helpful in catching typing mistakes, and it ishighly recommended that you adapt your programming style to make the best useof them.  However, you can turn them off and on at will, using the predicatesstyle_check/1 and no_style_check/1, which are described below.
