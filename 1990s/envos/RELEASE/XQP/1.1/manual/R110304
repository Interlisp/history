ref-11-3-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 11-3-4: LeashingAt any time, there is a leashing mode in force which determines at which of thefour ports of a procedure box (Call, Exit, Redo, and Fail) the debugger willstop and prompt you for input.  By default, you are prompted at every portshown by the debugger, but sometimes you may wish to reduce the number of timesyou have to type a response.  For example, it is often convenient only to haveto interact at the Call and Redo ports, and to have the debugger just print thegoal and continue at the Exit and Fail ports.  See the description of leash/1in {manual(ref-11-6-10)}, for more information.NOTE:  Spypoints are not affected by leashing; the debugger will always stop atevery port for a procedure on which there is a spypoint.
