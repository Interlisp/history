ref-4-2-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                      Section 4-2-5: module(+ModuleName)module(ModuleName) changes the type-in module to ModuleName.  Thus subsequenttop-level goals use ModuleName as their source module.ModuleName should be an atom that is the name of a module.  If ModuleName isnot a current module, a warning message is printed, but the type-in module ischanged nonetheless.  However, ModuleName does not become a current moduleuntil predicates are loaded into it.  If ModuleName is not an atom, module/1will fail, and an error message will be sent to the standard error stream.  See{manual(ref-13-13)}, for more information.Calling module/1 from a command embedded in a file that is being loaded doesnot affect the loading of clauses from that file.  It only affects subsequentgoals that are typed at top level.
