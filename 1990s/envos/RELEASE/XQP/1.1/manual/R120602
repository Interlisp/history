ref-12-6-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 12-6-2: tracetrace/0 turns the debugger on and starts it creeping; that is, it sets thedebugger to trace mode.  The debugger will start showing goals as soon as aninterpreted procedure is reached, and it will stop to allow you to interact assoon as it reaches a leashed port (see leash/1, {manual(ref-12-6-10)}).Setting the debugger to trace mode means that every time you type a query, thedebugger will start by creeping.The effect of this predicate can also be achieved by typing the letter 't'after a Control-c interrupt (see {manual(ref-11-1)}).Note that the top-level state of the debugger is ignored if you precede a goalwith a ':-  '; it is also ignored when goals to be executed appear in filesbeing consulted or compiled.  In these cases debugging is (initially) off.trace/0 has no associated error conditions.
