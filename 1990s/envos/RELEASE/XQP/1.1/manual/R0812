ref-8-12                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual             Section 8-12: numbervars(?Term, +FirstVar, -LastVar)numbervars(Term, FirstVar, LastVar) instantiates each of the variables in Termto a term of the form '$VAR'(N).  For example,| ?- Term = foo(A, A, B), numbervars(Term, 22, _), display(Term).foo($VAR(22),$VAR(22),$VAR(23))FirstVar must be an integer.  That integer is used as the value of N for thefirst variable in Term (starting from the left), as shown in the example above.The second distinct variable in Term is given a value of N satisfying "N isFirstVar+1"; the third distinct variable gets the value FirstVar+2, and so on.The last variable in Term has the value LastVar-1.Notice that in the example above, display/1 ({manual(ref-6-1-5)}) is usedrather thanwrite/1 ({manual(ref-6-1-2)}).  This is because write/1 treats termsof the form '$VAR'(N) specially; it writes 'A' if N=0, 'B' if N=1, ...'Z' ifN=25, 'A1' if N=26, etc.  That is why, if you type the goal in the exampleabove, the variable bindings will also be printed out as follows:              Term = foo(W,W,X),            A = W,            B = X
