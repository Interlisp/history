ref-5-1-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 5-1-2: write(?X)write(X) writes the term X to the current output stream.The term is written with respect to current operator declarations.  See{manual(ref-1-4)}, for a discussion of operators.  If X is uninstantiated, itis written as an anonymous variable (an underscore followed by a non-negativeinteger).Atoms output by write/1 cannot in general be read back using read/[1,2].  Forexample,             | ?- write('a b').            a bIf you want to be sure that the atom can be read back by read/[1,2], you shoulduse writeq/[1,2], or write_canonical/[1,2] which put quotes around atoms whennecessary.Note that the output of write/1 is not terminated by a full-stop; therefore, ifyou want the term to be acceptable as input to read/[1,2], you must send theterminating full-stop to the output stream yourself.write/1 treats terms of the form '$VAR'(N) specially:  it writes 'A' if N=0,'B' if N=1, ...'Z' if N=25, 'A1' if N=26, etc.  Terms of this form aregenerated by numbervars/3 (see {manual(ref-7-12)}).write/1 always succeeds without error.
