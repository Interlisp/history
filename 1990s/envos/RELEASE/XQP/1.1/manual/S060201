sysdep-6-2-1            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                             Section 6-2-1: helpThis simply gives basic information, such as how to start using the help systemand how to exit from Prolog.A hook is provided so that users can add to or replace this information:help/0 first calls user_help/0, and if that succeeds help/0 does nothing else.Only if the call to user_help/0 fails is the standard information displayed.help/0 always calls user_help/0 in module 'user'.  therefore, to be visible tohelp/0, user_help/0 must either be defined in or imported into module 'user'.
