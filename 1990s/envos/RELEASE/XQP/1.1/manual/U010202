user-1-2-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                 Section 1-2-2: Asking Prolog for InformationPredicate names in Prolog are always written starting with a lowercase letter.The specific items (or constants) for which the predicate is true are alsowritten beginning with a lowercase letter.  However, we don't always want tosimply name the items for which a given predicate is true.  Sometimes we wantto ask or (query) the system for the names of these items.  To do this, we typethe predicate with a variable as its argument.  A variable is distinguishedfrom a constant by its initial uppercase letter, as below:            | ?- yellow(Fruit).<CR>            Fruit = lemon <CR>            | ?-Here, we are asking the system for an example of a fruit which is yellow.  Thesystem replies that it knows that a fruit which is yellow is the lemon.  Atthis point, since we wish no more answers, we reply with a <CR>, and the systemreturns to the top-level prompt.If you wish for the system to search for another answer, type a semicolon (;)after a successful answer:            | ?- oval(Fruit).<CR>            Fruit = lemon ;<CR>            Fruit = lime ;<CR>            no            | ?-The semicolon directs the system to discard the current answer and search foran alternative one; this discarding and re-searching is known as backtracking.If you continue typing semicolons, the system will continue backtracking andsupplying new answers until there are none left; then it will reply 'no',signifying that there are no (more) alternative answers, and return to thetop-level prompt.
