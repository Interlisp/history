ref-5-3-17                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual              Section 5-3-17: source_file(?PredSpec, ?FileSpec)If PredSpec is instantiated to the skeletal specification (see{manual(ref-2-1-1)}, for a definition of "skeletal") of a loaded predicate,then FileSpec will be successively unified with the absolute names (see{manual(ref-5-3-15)}) of the files in which the PredSpec was defined.If PredSpec is not a loaded predicate, then source_file/2 simply fails.  Ifbound to an illegal predicate specification, it fails, sends an error messageto the standard error stream; the system then enters the debugger in tracemode.If FileSpec is instantiated to the absolute name of a loaded file, thenPredSpec will be successively unified with the skeletal specifications of allpredicates defined in FileSpec.If FileSpec is not a loaded file, source_file/2 fails.
