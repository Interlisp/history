ref-5-3-9                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                          Section 5-3-9: fileerrorsfileerrors/0 cancels the effect of nofileerrors/0.  It sets the 'fileerrors'flag to its default state in which an error message is produced by see/1,tell/1, and open/3 if the specified file cannot be opened.  The error messageis followed by an abort/0; that is, execution of the program is abandoned andthe system returns to top level.The 'fileerrors' flag is only disabled by an explicit call to fileerrors/0, orvia prolog_flag/[2,3] which can also be used to obtain the current value of thefileerrors flag.  See {manual(ref-18-3)}, for more information on thefileerrors flag.fileerrors/0 has no associated error conditions.
