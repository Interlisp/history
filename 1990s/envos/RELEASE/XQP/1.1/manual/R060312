ref-6-3-12                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                     Section 6-3-12: set_output(+Stream)set_output(Stream) makes Stream the current output stream.  Subsequent outputpredicates such as write/1 and put/1 will henceforth use this stream.If Stream is not a valid output stream, set_output(Stream) fails, and sends anerror message to the standard error stream.  The system then enters thedebugger in trace mode.
