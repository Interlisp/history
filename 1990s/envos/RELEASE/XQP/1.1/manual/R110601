ref-11-6-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 11-6-1: debugdebug/0 turns the debugger on and sets the debugger to debug mode.  Turning thedebugger on means that it will stop at the next spypoint encountered in thecurrent execution.  Setting the debugger to debug mode means that the debuggerwill start by not showing any goals (and not stopping) until it reaches aspypoint; that is, it will leap.  Once you reach a spypoint you will have anumber of options, including those of creeping forwards or of leaping onceagain.The effect of this predicate can also be achieved by typing the letter 'd'after a Control-c interrupt (see {manual(ref-10-1)}).Note that the top-level state of the debugger is ignored if you precede a goalwith a ':-  '; it is also ignored when goals to be executed appear in filesbeing consulted or compiled.  In these cases debugging is (initially) off.debug/0 has no associated error conditions.
