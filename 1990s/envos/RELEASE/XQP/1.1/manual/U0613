user-6-13                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide             Section 6-13: Redefining Procedures during ExecutionIf you use the b (break) option and redefine a procedure during the break, thenew definition of the procedure will be used the next time the procedure iscalled.  However, if you were in the midst of executing the procedure when youused the b (break) option, the old definition will continue to be used when youreturn from the break.  Therefore, when you have redefined a procedure, youshould go back to the point where you entered that procedure.  (There is a'retry' option (r <i>) which allows you to undo the current computation back toa particular procedure invocation.  See the Xerox Quintus Prolog ReferenceManual for more information.)
