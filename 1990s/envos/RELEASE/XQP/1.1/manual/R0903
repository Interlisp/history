ref-9-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 9-3: current_atom(?Atom)current_atom(Atom) succeeds if and only if Atom is an atom.  Note that thepredicate atom/1 ({manual(ref-7-3)}) is recommended for determining if a termis an atom.If Atom is uninstantiated, current_atom/1 backtracks through all known atoms.If the argument is not an atom or an unbound variable, current_atom/1 simplyfails.
