ref-5-3-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                         Section 5-3-0: IntroductionEach input and output built-in predicate refers implicitly or explicitly to astream.  Streams may be connected to a file or to the user's terminal.  Eachuser-defined stream is used either for input or for output, but not for both.Each operating system permits a different number of streams to be open.  Formore information on this, refer to the Xerox Quintus Prolog System-dependentFeatures Manual.
