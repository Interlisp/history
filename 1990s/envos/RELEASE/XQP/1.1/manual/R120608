ref-12-6-8                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 12-6-8: nospyallnospyall/0 removes all spypoints.  This is the only way to remove all yourspypoints at once, since turning off debugging with nodebug/0 does not removespypoints; they remain in place and are reactivated if the debugger is turnedback on using trace/0 or debug/0.nospyall/0 has no associated error conditions.
