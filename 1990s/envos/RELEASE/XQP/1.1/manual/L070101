lib-7-1-1                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual             Section 7-1-1: The Cross-referencer -- library(xref)The 'xref' program can be used to generate a list of all the cross referencesfor each predicate.  It has considerable flexibility for excluding or includingdesired predicates.  Details on the use of 'xref' may be found by reading thefile tools/xref.doc.A second function of 'xref' is to aid in the formation of module statements.'xref' can list all of the required module/2 and use_module/2 statements byfile.  These module/2 and use_module/2 statements can not only be collectedinto a single file, but each set of statements can also automatically beincluded at the top of each appropriate file, thereby doing most of the workrequired to convert a Prolog program which spans more than one file into a setof Prolog modules.  See the Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual for moreinformation on modules.
