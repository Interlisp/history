user-4-4                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide             Section 4-4: Interrupting the Execution of a ProgramYou can interrupt the execution of a Prolog program at any time by typingControl-c.  For example, if you submit a question to Prolog and then decide youwant to stop (abort) the query, type Control-c, to which Prolog will respond bydisplaying the message             Prolog interruption (h for help)?At this point, you can either type 'h' to see a list of the options availableto you, as shown below, or you can simply type the letter that corresponds tothe option you want to select.If you type 'h', Prolog displays the following list of options:            Interrupt Options:                c    continue - do nothing                t    trace    - debugger will start creeping                d    debug    - debugger will start leaping                a    abort    - cause a Prolog abort                e    exit     - irreversible exit from Prolog                h    help     - this list            Prolog interruption (h for help)?To select an option, type the letter that corresponds to that option and pressthe Return key.  For example, to stop the execution of the current query, type'a' followed by the Return key.  Prolog will print            [Execution aborted]and then return to its top level, displaying the main Prolog prompt.Typing 'c' causes the current procedure to continue executing as if nothing hadhappened.  Typing 't' turns on the 'trace' option of the debugger (see{manual(user-6-2)}).  Typing 'd' turns on the 'debug' option of the debugger(see {manual(user-6-2)}).  Typing 'a' causes the current query to be abortedand the main Prolog prompt to be redisplayed, as shown above.  Typing 'e' endsyour Prolog session.
