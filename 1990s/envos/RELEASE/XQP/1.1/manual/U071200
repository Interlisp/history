user-7-12-0                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                      Section 7-12-0: Basic InformationThis section describes the options that you can select in response to the '?'prompt, which the debugger displays at every leashed port.  The options areone-letter mnemonics, some of which optionally can be followed by a decimalinteger.  If you include blanks, they are ignored.To see a list of the debugging options, type 'h' (for help) in response to the'?' prompt.  When you type 'h' (followed by Return), the following list ofoptions is displayed:Debugging options<cr>  creep      p      print         r      retry        @    command c    creep      w      write         r <i>  retry i      b    break l    leap       d      display       f      fail         a    abort s    skip       g      ancestors     f <i>  fail i       h    help n    nodebug    g <n>  n ancestors   +      spy this     ?    help x    backup     < <n>  set depth     -      nospy this   =    debugging                 .      find defnTo select an option, type the character representing the option and press theReturn key.These options provide a number of different functions, which fall into thefollowing classes:   Basic control    -- The basic ways of continuing execution   Printing         -- Showing the goal, or its ancestors, in various ways   Advanced control -- Affecting control flow and changing spypoints   Environment      -- Executing commands, breaking, and aborting   Help             -- Showing the debugger state and listing optionsA brief description of each debugging option is given below.  For completedescriptions of all the debugging options, refer to the Xerox Quintus PrologReference Manual.
