sysdep-5-9            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                          Section 5-9: Miscellaneous   1. If a file name specified in a compile/1 or consult/1 command does      not end with the characters ".pl", Xerox Quintus Prolog adds a ".pl"      extension to the file name before searching for it.  If there is no      file with the extended name, it tries again without the ".pl"      extension.  Thus you can type                   | ?- [myfile].      instead of                   | ?- ['myfile.pl'].   2. The printing of answers to questions has been slightly enhanced:      variables which have been bound to the same value are grouped      together, thus                   | ?- X = 1, Y = 1.                  X = Y = 1      Note that if a variable is bound to another uninstantiated variable      then these variables are grouped together as well.                    | ?- U=V, W=X.                  U = V = _27,                  W = X = _60      Also, when a named variable in a question occurs in a structure but      remains unbound, its name is printed in that structure rather than      the arbitrary identifier of the form _<integer> which is more      normally used.  For example,                   | ?- X = f(Y).                  X = f(Y),                  Y = _51   3. Atoms in Xerox Lisp are a maximum of 255 characters in length.      Also, no atom can have a name which looks like a number.
