ref-14-2-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 14-2-2: asserta(+Clause)asserta(Clause) adds Clause to the data base as the first clause of itsprocedure.Clause must be instantiated to a non-numeric value.  If it is of the form'Head :- Body', then Head must also be instantiated to a non-numeric value.  Ifthese conditions are not satisfied, then asserta/1 fails, and an error messageis sent to the standard error stream.  If there is a static definition for thespecified predicate, then asserta/1 will fail, an error message is sent to thestandard error stream, and the system enters the debugger in trace mode.Syntactic note:  if you want to write a term of the form 'Head :- Body' as theargument to asserta/1, you must put it in parentheses, because the operatorprecedence of the ':-'/2 functor is greater than 1000 (see {manual(ref-2-6)}).
