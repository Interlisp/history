This also shows whichdebugging ports are leashed (that is, which ports the debugger will stop at)and the default action that will be taken if the system encounters an undefinedprocedure.| ?- debugging.The debugger will first leap -- showing spypoints (debug)Using leashing stopping at [call,exit,redo,fail] portsUndefined procedures will trap to the debugger ('trace' option)Spypoints:            test/1            append/3yes| ?-This information is also available via the "=" option when you are at adebugger prompt.  For example, given the procedure in {manual(user-7-5)},debugging might proceed as follows:| ?- spy works_directly_for/2.[The debugger will first leap -- showing spypoints (debug)][Spypoint placed on works_directly_for/2]yes[debug]| ?- works_for(X, Y).** (2) 1 Call: works_directly_for(_41,_56) ? =The debugger will first leap -- showing spypoints (debug)Using leashing stopping at [call,exit,redo,fail] portsUndefined procedures will trap to the debugger ('trace' option)Spypoints:            works_directly_for/2** (2) 1 Call: works_directly_for(_41,_56) ?
