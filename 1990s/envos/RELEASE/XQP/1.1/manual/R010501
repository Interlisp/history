ref-1-5-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                 Section 1-5-1: op(+Precedence, +Type, +Name)op(Precedence, Type, Name) declares the atom Name to be an operator of thestated Type and Precedence (refer to {manual(ref-1-4)}).  Name may also be alist of atoms, in which case all of the atoms in the list are declared to beoperators.  If Precedence is 0, then the operator properties of Name (if any)are cancelled.op/3 always succeeds; however, if any of the arguments is uninstantiated, or isnot of the expected form, it sends an error message to the standard errorstream.To examine the set of operators currently in force, use current_op/3({manual(ref-1-5-2)}).
