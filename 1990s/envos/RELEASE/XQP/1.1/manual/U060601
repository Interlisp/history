Note that since 'spy' is abuilt-in operator, the parentheses which usually surround the arguments to apredicate are not necessary (although they can be used if desired).  | ?- spy test/1.[The debugger will first leap -- showing spypoints (debug)][Spypoint placed on test/1]yes| ?-NOTE:  You can set a spypoint at any time, whether the debugger is on or off;and if on, whether it is in trace or debug mode.  If the debugger is off,setting a spypoint will set it to debug mode as shown in the above example.To set several spypoints at once, type 'spy' followed by a list, enclosed insquare brackets, of the names and arities of the predicates you want toexamine.  For example:            | ?- spy [transform/2,transform/3].            [Spypoint placed on transform/2]            [Spypoint placed on transform/3]            yes            | ?-To set spypoints on all existing predicates of a given name, type 'spy'followed by the name of the predicate, as shown in the example below.  This isa quick way of placing spypoints on predicates, particularly if you cannotremember their arities.            | ?- spy transform.            [Spypoint placed on transform/2]            [Spypoint placed on transform/3]            yes            | ?-
