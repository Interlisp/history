ref-2-1-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                             Section 2-1-3: AtomsAn atom is identified by its name, which is a sequence of zero or morecharacters (other than the character 10'0).  See the Xerox Quintus PrologSystem-dependent Features Manual to find out how many characters an atom's namemay contain.  An atom can be written in any of the following forms:   - Any sequence of alphanumeric characters (including '_'), starting     with a lowercase letter.  Note that an atom may not begin with an     underscore.   - Any sequence from the following set of characters (except '/*', which     begins a comment):                 + - * / \ ^ < > = ` ~ : . ? @ # $ &   - Any sequence of characters delimited by single quotes. If the single     quote character is included in the sequence it must be written twice,     for example:                   'can''t'.   - Any of:                 ! ; [] {}     Note that the bracket pairs are special:  '[]' and '{}' are atoms but     '[', ']', '{', and '}' are not.  The form [X] is a special notation     for lists (see {manual(ref-2-2-1)}), and the form {X} is allowed as     an alternative to '{}'(X).Examples of atoms are:            a   void   =   :=   'Anything in quotes'   []WARNING:  it is recommended that you do not invent atoms beginning with thecharacter '$', since it is possible that such names may conflict with the namesof atoms having special significance for certain built-in predicates.
