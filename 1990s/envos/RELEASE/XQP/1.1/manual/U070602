user-7-6-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide             Section 7-6-2: Using Spypoints to Debug a ProcedureOnce you have set spypoints, type the name of the procedure you want to debugat the main Prolog prompt.  The system then begins showing you the programexecution at the first spypoint you've set.  You can continue examiningspypoints (leaping) by typing 'l', or you can switch to more detailed debugging(creeping) by pressing the Return key, any time the system prompts you with aquestion mark.The example shown below uses the same procedure that was used in the example in{manual(user-7-5)}.  However, this time a spypoint is placed on the procedurefor works_directly_for/2, so the call to that procedure is the first onedisplayed when you type the goal 'works_for(X, Y)'.  Note also that in responseto the question-mark prompt, the letter 'l' is typed instead of Return.  The'l' stands for "leap", which means "leap to the next spypoint".  Leaping isdiscussed in more detail in {manual(user-7-7)}.            | ?- spy works_directly_for/2.            [Spypoint placed on works_directly_for/2]            | ?- works_for(X, Y).            ** (2) 1 Call: works_directly_for(_41,_56) ? l            ** (2) 1 Exit: works_directly_for(john,mary) ? l            X = john,            Y = mary <CR>            | ?-
