user-7-6-0                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                       Section 7-6-0: Basic InformationTo debug only selected procedures in a program, type 'debug.' at the mainProlog prompt.  Then set a spypoint on each procedure you want to debug.  Aspypoint is a type of marker.  By setting spypoints on certain procedures, youdirect the debugger to display debugging information whenever one of thoseprocedures is reached.  Having arrived at a spypoint, however, you can choosebetween single-stepping ("creeping") or continuing to the next spypoint("leaping").
