user-2-1-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                        Section 2-1-2: Entering PrologTo enter Prolog, select the Prolog option from the main background menu.  TEditcreates a Prolog window, as shown below.The first time that Prolog is started after creating a new Lisp image, thesystem will display the message:Grabbing an additional 4mb of memory.  This will take a while.and proceed to do so.  This will take approximately five minutes.  Note thatthis is only necessary immediately after creation of a new Lisp image.NOTE:  The Prolog option has a suboption, Start New Prolog, which you can seeby sliding the cursor to the right of the menu while holding down the rightmouse button.  If you select the Prolog option from the main background menu,Prolog will be started up without destroying any current clauses in the Prologdata base.  If you need to start a fresh Prolog with a reinitialized data base,select the Start New Prolog suboption.  There is no difference between the twowhen you start Prolog for the first time after starting a new Lisp image.Xerox Quintus PrologXerox Quintus Prolog Release 2.0Copyright (C) 1987, Quintus Computer Systems, Inc.                    All rights reserved.Copyright (C) 1987, Xerox Corporation.                    All rights reserved.| ?-The top line of the window is the prompt region.  Beneath that line is a blacktitle bar, which identifies the window's contents.The cursor is positioned to the right of the Prolog prompt (| ?- ) in theProlog window, indicating that you are at the top level of the Prolog system.Prolog commands can be executed from this point as described in the section onProlog prompts below.NOTE:  Prolog runs under TExec, so TExec functions are available within theProlog window.  For more information on TExec, refer to the Xerox Lisp LibraryModules Manual.
