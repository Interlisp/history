ref-6-1-7                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 6-1-7: portray_clause(+Clause)portray_clause(Clause) writes the clause Clause to the current output stream.portray_clause/1 is the operation used by listing/0 and listing/1.  Clause iswritten to the current output stream in exactly the format in which listing/1would have written it, including a terminating full-stop.If you want to print a clause, this is almost certainly the command you want.By design, none of the other term output commands puts a full-stop after thewritten term.  If you are writing a file of facts to be loaded by consult/1 orcompile/1, use portray_clause/1, which attempts to ensure that the clauses itwrites out can be read in again as clauses.The output format used by portray_clause/1 and listing/1 has been carefullydesigned to be clear.  We recommend that you use a similar style.  Inparticular, never put a semicolon (disjunction symbol) at the end of a line inProlog.portray_clause/1 always succeeds without error.
