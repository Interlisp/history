ref-6-5-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual             Section 6-5-5: stream_position(+Stream, -Old, +New)stream_position(Stream, Old, New) unifies the current position of theread/write pointer for Stream with Old, then sets the position to New.  Old andNew are both stream position objects.stream_position/3 is much like prolog_flag/3 (see {manual(ref-19-3)}).Normally, you supply a variable as Old, so that you can restore the currentposition later.  Often Old is an anonymous variable.  New must be instantiatedto a legal stream position object; otherwise, stream_position/3 fails.Note that this operation only makes sense on streams that are connected to diskfiles.  If Stream is any other type of stream, or is not a valid stream,stream_position/3 will fail and send an error message to the standard errorstream.A stream position object is represented by a special Prolog term.  The onlysafe way of obtaining such an object is via stream_position/3 orstream_position/2.  You should not try to construct, change, or rely on theform of this object.  It may vary under different operating systems and/orchange in subsequent versions of Xerox Quintus Prolog.  On some systems, astream position object currently has the form             '$stream_position'(CharCount, LineCount, LinePos)Standard term comparison of two stream position objects for the same streamwill work as one expects.  When SP1 and SP2 refer to the same stream,SP1 @< SP2 if and only if SP1 is before SP2 in the stream.
