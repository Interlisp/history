lib-4-8                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                        Section 4-8: Generating Atomslibrary(strings) defines three predicates for generating atoms.gensym(+Prefix, -Atom)            is equivalent to concat_atom([Prefix, N], Atom), where N is the            next number in the sequence associated with Prefix.  Notionally,            each Prefix has its own counter, starting with zero.  Prefix must            be an atom.  Examples:                        | ?- gensym(a, X).                        X = a1                        | ?- gensym(a, X).                        X = a2                        | ?- gensym(b, X).                        X = b1                        | ?- gensym(1, X).                        nogensym(-Atom)            uses the Prefix '%'.  Example:                        | ?- gensym(X).                        X = '%58'cgensym(+Prefix, ?Atom)            if Atom is a variable, it generates a new atom using gensym/2.            Otherwise, Prefix and Atom should be atoms.  The name is to be read            as "conditionally generate symbol".These predicates are included for compatibility with the DEC-10 Prolog library,which has contained them for several years.gensym/[1,2] are very similar to the Lisp function (GENSYM), except that thedefault prefix is '%' rather than 'A', each Prefix has its own counter, and thecounters start from 1 rather than 10000.  cgensym/2 will do nothing to Atom ifit is already bound; otherwise it is just like gensym/2.
