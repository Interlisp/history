ref-13-9                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                 Section 13-9: Creating a Module DynamicallyThere are several ways in which you can create a module without loading amodule-file for it.  Doing this has the disadvantage that there is then notextual representation of the program that you are running, but it can beuseful in some circumstances.One way to do this is by asserting clauses into a specified module.  Forexample, the command:            | ?- assert(m:f(x)).will create the dynamic predicate f/1 and the module m if they did notpreviously exist.Another way to create a module dynamically is to compile or consult anon-module-file into a specified module.  For example,            | ?- compile(M:File).will compile the clauses in File into the module M.  The same effect can beachieved by (temporarily) changing the type-in module to M (see{manual(ref-13-8)}) and then calling 'compile(File)'.
