ref-18-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 18-5: prompt(-Old, +New)prompt(Old, New) may be used to query or change the sequence of characters(prompt) that indicates that the system is waiting for user input.  The atomrepresenting the current prompt is unified with Old.  New must be an atom, andspecifies the prompt to be used until the next time the Prolog top level isreached.  As a special case, the goal             prompt(X, X)matches the current prompt to X without changing it.This predicate affects only the prompt given when a user's program is trying toread from the terminal (for example, by calling read/1).  Note also that theprompt is reset to the default "|: " on return to the top level.
