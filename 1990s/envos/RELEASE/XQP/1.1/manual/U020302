user-2-3-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                  Section 2-3-2: Following Cross-referencesThe NextRef! and GoToRef! functions in the extended menu of the XQPInfo toolare used to find and follow cross-references embedded in the text of themanual.  Cross-references in the text look like this in the on-line manual:            see {manual(user-6-1-1)}Activating NextRef! will search the currently displayed text for the nextcross-reference.  If one exists, the text display will be updated to show it incontext.  Then by activating the GoToRef! function (by left-mousing as always)the XQPInfo system will locate that section of the manual and display it.  Youcan always reurn to where you were by using the History function, whichprovides a historical record of the visited locations in the manual in the formof a menu of topic titles, any of which can be revisited by left-mousing them.
