ref-6-7-7                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 6-7-7: ttyflushttyflush/0 flushes the terminal output buffer.  Output to the terminal, usingeither ttyput/1 or put/[1,2], normally goes into an output buffer until anewline is written.  Calling ttyflush/0 forces any characters in this buffer tobe displayed immediately.For flushing output that is not directed to the terminal, see flush_output/1,{manual(ref-6-3-10)}.
