sysdep-2-7            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                  Section 2-7: Starting The Prolog Top Level    (PROLOG.EXEC NEW? REGION)                                        [Function]        If there is currently no Xerox Quintus Prolog top level running,        PROLOG.EXEC will start one.  If NEW? is specified and is not NIL, then        the Prolog data base will be cleared before Prolog is started.  Since        this is a drastic action, you will first be prompted to confirm whether        or not you wish to clear the data base.  If REGION is specified, the        Prolog window will occupy this region (see the Interlisp-D Reference        Manual for information about regions).  If no region is specified and        there has previously been a Prolog window, that window will be reused.        Otherwise, you will be prompted to specify a region for the Prolog        window.    PROLOGFONT                                                       [Variable]        This is the font to be used in the Prolog top-level window.  PROLOGFONT        defaults to Terminal 10.  If a larger font is desired, you might change        this variable to Terminal 12, or a Modern or Classic font.  Note that a        change to this variable will not have any effect until the next time        the Prolog executive is restarted.        Some Prolog features (for example, statistics/0) assume a fixed-width        font, so using a proportional font will cause columns to be misaligned.        See the Interlisp-D Reference Manual for information about fonts.
