ref-14-3-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                         Section 14-3-0: IntroductionThis section describes the predicates used to remove the clauses and/orproperties of a predicate from the system.NOTE:  Removing all of a predicate's clauses by retract/1 and/or erase/1 (see{manual(ref-15-6)}) does not remove the predicate's properties (and hence itsdefinition) from the system.  The only way to completely remove a predicate'sclauses and properties is to use abolish/[1,2] ({manual(ref-14-3-4)}, and{manual(ref-14-3-5)}).
