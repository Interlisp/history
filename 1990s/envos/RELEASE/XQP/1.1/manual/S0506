sysdep-5-6            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                  Section 5-6: Stream-based Input and OutputIn addition to fully supporting the DEC-10 Prolog I/O predicates, Xerox QuintusProlog supports the more powerful concept of streams.  A stream is a specialProlog term, and there is a version of each of the DEC-10 Prolog I/O predicateswhich takes an extra stream argument.A new predicate, open/3, opens a file in one of three modes, 'read', 'write' or'append'.For more information on streams and their use, see the Xerox Quintus PrologReference Manual.
