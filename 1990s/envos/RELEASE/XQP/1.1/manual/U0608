user-6-8                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide           Section 6-8: Requesting More or Less Frequent PromptingBy default, the debugger stops at all four ports (Call, Exit, Redo, and Fail)and prompts you to specify the next action that should be taken.  The ports atwhich the debugger stops are referred to as "leashed" ports.If you want to change the leashed ports -- that is, to request that thedebugger stop and prompt you at only some of the ports rather than all of them-- you can easily do so by using the leash/1 predicate.  For example,            | ?- leash([call,redo]).will cause the debugger to stop only at the Call and Redo ports; at Exit andFail ports it will just print a message and continue.  (See the Xerox QuintusProlog Reference Manual for more information.)NOTE:  Leashing does not affect predicates on which spypoints have been set;the debugger always stops at all ports of predicates on which spypoints havebeen set.
