sysdep-6-1-3            Xerox Quintus Prolog System-Dependent Features Manual                       Section 6-1-3: Global VariablesThe following variables are used to determine the behavior of the XQPInfo tool.XQPINFOMODES                                                         [Variable]            Determines which of the toggles will be selected when XQPInfo is            initially started; it should be a list with recognized members            being GRAPH, MENU, TEXT, and HISTORY.  Default is (GRAPH TEXT).XQPINFO.HISTORY.LENGTH                                               [Variable]            Determines the maximum length of XQPInfo's history.  The default            length is 20.XQPINFO.GRAPHS                                                       [Variable]            Determines the contents of the menu raised by selecting XQPInfo            from the background menu.  Should be a menu-items style list such            that when the CADR of an item is evaluated it returns either an            XQPInfo Graph (an XQPINFOGRAPH record) or the name of a file            containing an XQPInfo Graph (that is, something suitable for            passing to XQPInfo as the GRAPH.OR.FILE argument).
