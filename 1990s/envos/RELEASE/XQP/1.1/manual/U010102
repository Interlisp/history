user-1-1-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                          Section 1-1-2: PredicatesEach of the facts "I should drive to work", "it is cold", and "it is raining"is a proposition that can be true of a given day.  Such a proposition is knownas a predicate, and the factors determining whether the proposition is true orfalse in a given instance are supplied to it as arguments.  For example, thepredicate instance            drive_to_work(tuesday)represents the English language proposition            I should drive to work Tuesday.The predicate is referred to as drive_to_work/1, signifying that it takes oneargument:  the day in question.  In Prolog, the name of a predicate is alwayswritten beginning with a lowercase letter, and with no spaces.  Constants(symbols referring to a specific item as opposed to a class of items) are alsowritten without spaces, and beginning with a lowercase letter.  Since we arereferring to a specific day (Tuesday), the word "tuesday" is written in thisway as well.  Rewriting our sample driving rule using this syntax, we get            drive_to_work(tuesday) if                    it_is_cold(tuesday) and                    it_is_raining(tuesday).
