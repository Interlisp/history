ref-0-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                  Section 0-1: Notation Used in This ManualEach built-in predicate definition is headed by a goal template such as            setof(?X, +Goal, -Set)Here X, Goal, and Set are meta-variables which name the arguments so that wedon't have to keep saying "its first argument", and so on.  The characterswhich precede the meta-variables will seem familiar if you know the modedeclarations of DEC-10 Prolog; however, our use of these characters is somewhatmore general.  The meanings of the '+', '-', and '?' mode annotations aredifferent in Xerox Quintus Prolog than the meanings of the comparable modedeclarations in DEC-10 Prolog.  The significance of these "mode annotations" isas follows:    +   This argument is an input to the predicate.  It must initially be        instantiated or the predicate fails and sends an error message to the        standard error stream.    -   This argument is an output.  It is returned by the predicate.  That is,        the output value is unified with any value which was supplied for this        argument.  The predicate fails if this unification fails.  If no value        is supplied, the predicate succeeds, and the output variable is unified        with the return value.    ?   This argument does not fall into either of the above categories.  It        may be either an input or an output, and may be instantiated or not, as        required by its application.
