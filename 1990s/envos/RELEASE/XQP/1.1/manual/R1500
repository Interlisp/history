ref-15-0                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 15-0: OverviewThe following predicates are provided solely for efficiency.  Their semanticscan be understood by imagining that they are defined by the following clauses:            recorda(Key, Term, Ref) :-                 asserta('$recorded'(Key,Term), Ref).            recordz(Key, Term, Ref) :-                 assertz('$recorded'(Key,Term), Ref).            recorded(Key, Term, Ref) :-                 clause('$recorded'(Key,Term), _, Ref).In the actual implementation there is a fast lookup using the Key.NOTE:  since streams (see {manual(ref-5-3-3)}), and stream positions (see{manual(ref-5-5-5)}) are represented by compound terms, the recorded data baseregards all streams and stream positions as defining exactly the same key.  Youare allowed to use these terms as keys, but be aware of this problem, and thatthis behavior may change in a future release.In some implementations, data base references are also represented by compoundterms, and thus subject to the limitation described above.
