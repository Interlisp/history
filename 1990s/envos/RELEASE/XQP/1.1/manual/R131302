ref-13-13-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                Section 13-13-2: current_module(Module, File)The predicate current_module/2 gives the relation between modules and theirassociated module-files.  It can be called like this:            | ?- current_module(Module, File).It is possible for a current module to have no associated file, in which casecurrent_module/1 will succeed on it but current_module/2 will fail.  Thisarises for the special module 'user' and for dynamically-created modules (see{manual(ref-13-9)}).If its arguments are not correct, or if Module has no associated file,current_module/2 simply fails.
