ref-2-1-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 2-1-4: VariablesVariables may be written as any sequence of alphanumeric characters (including'_') beginning with either a capital letter or '_'.  For example:              X   Value   A   A1   _3   _RESULTIf a variable is referred to only once in a clause, it does not need to benamed and may be written as an anonymous variable, indicated by the underlinecharacter '_'.  Any number of anonymous variables may appear in a clause; theyare read as distinct variables.  Anonymous variables are not special atruntime.
