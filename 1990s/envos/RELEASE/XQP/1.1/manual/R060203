ref-6-2-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 6-2-3: skip(+N)skip(N) skips over characters from the current input stream through the firstoccurrence of the character with ASCII code N.  N may be an integer expression.The most useful form of integer expression in this context is a singlecharacter in double quotes, for example, "a" which evaluates to 97, the ASCIIcode for the letter 'a', so that:              | ?- skip("a").skips over (ignores) all input until the next occurrence of the letter 'a'.If N is not a valid arithmetic expression, then skip/1 fails and sends an errormessage to the standard error stream.  If N evaluates to a float, or an integeroutside the range 0..255, then skip/1 simply fails.If N does not appear on the current input stream, an error message is given forreading beyond the end of the stream, and the computation is aborted.  If Ndoes appear, skip/1 will consume it, so that get0/1 will read the followingcharacter.skip/1 cannot skip to the end of the current input stream:  to do this, executethe following:            | ?- repeat, get0(-1), !.
