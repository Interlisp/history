lib-7-5-0                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                           Section 7-5-0: overviewThere are two library files for reading sentences.  One of them islibrary(read_in), which defines the single predicate read_in/1.library(read_in) was written to be used.  library(read_sent) was originallywritten to be read and modified, as everyone has a different idea of howsentence reading should be done.  Nevertheless, you may find read_sent/1 to bequite useful.Both sentence readers work by reading characters until some terminationcondition and then parsing a list of character codes using a Definite ClauseGrammar.  You can have any number of grammars in one Prolog program.  You willprobably find that read_in/1 does most of what you want, but if you want to dosomething different you may find it easier to modify read_sent/1.
