ref-7-10                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                        Section 7-10: ?Pred =.. ?ListPred =.. List unifies List with a list whose head is the atom corresponding tothe principal functor of Pred and whose tail is a list of the arguments ofPred.  If Pred is uninstantiated, then List must be instantiated either to alist of determinate length whose head is an atom, or to a list of length 1whose head is a number.  Some examples of its use are:              | ?- foo(a,b) =.. X.            X = [foo,a,b]            | ?- X =.. [foo,a,b].            X = foo(a,b)            | ?- foo =.. X.            X = [foo]            | ?- X =.. [1.2].            X = 1.2If Pred and List are both uninstantiated, or if either is not what is expected,'=..'/2 will fail, and an error message will be sent to the standard errorstream.'=..'/2 is sometimes pronounced "univ", after a predicate of that name andsimilar function in the original Marseilles implementation of Prolog.
