ref-5-3-6                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 5-3-6: close(+X)close(X) closes the stream corresponding to X.If X is a stream object, then if the corresponding stream is open, it will beclosed; otherwise, close/1 succeeds immediately, taking no action.If X is an atom, it is taken to be a file name, and the corresponding streamwill be closed.  It is only closed if the file was opened by see/1({manual(ref-5-6-1)}).  In the example            see(foo),            ...            close(foo)'foo' will be closed.  However, in the example            open(foo, read, S),            ...            close(foo)an error message will be printed and 'foo' will not be closed.For DEC-10 Prolog compatibility, if X is an atom, close(X) always succeeds,even if the corresponding file is not currently open.  However, an errormessage is printed in this case, unlike in DEC-10 Prolog.If X is neither a stream object nor an atom, close(X) fails and sends an errormessage to the standard error stream.
