user-3-6                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                      Section 3-6: Syntax Error MessagesWhen a file is read into Prolog using consult/1 or compile/1, Prologautomatically checks the clauses in the file for correctness of syntax.  If aclause contains a syntax error, Prolog tells you that a syntax error has beenfound and displays the clause that contains the error.For example, suppose you accidentally omitted a closing parenthesis in aclause, as shown below.              member(X,[a,b,c,d].When you directed Prolog to load the file containing the above clause, Prologwould load all the clauses that preceded the clause containing the error.  Whenit reached this clause, it would display the message             ** Syntax error:  **            member ( X,[a , b , c , d ]            ** here **to let you know that the syntax of the clause was incorrect and at what pointin the clause it found the syntax error.  Prolog would then ignore the clauseand continue loading the rest of the file into the data base.
