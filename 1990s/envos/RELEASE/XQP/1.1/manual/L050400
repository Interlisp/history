lib-5-4-0                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual                         Section 5-4-0: IntroductionDEC-10 Prolog, C-Prolog, and Quintus Prolog provide two inequality operations:Term1 \== Term2            Term1 is not currently identical to Term2Expr1 =\= Expr2            Expr1 and Expr2 are arithmetic expressions with different values'=\='/2 is reasonably straightforward.  Either it is true, and will remaintrue, or it is false, and will remain false, or the Prolog system will reportan error if it cannot determine which.  Thus 1 =\= 2 is true, 1 =\= 1.0 isfalse, and _ =\= 3 will result in an error message.'\=='/2 is not really a logical relation, but a meta-logical relation likevar/1.  It tests whether two terms are exactly identical, down to having thesame variables in the same places.  It either succeeds or fails; and if itfails it will continue to do so, but if it succeeds it may fail later on.  Forexample,| ?- X \== Y,  % succeeds|    X  =  Y,  % succeeds, unifying X and Y|    X \== Y.  % FAILS, now that X and Y are unifiednoIt is safe to use '=='/2 and '\=='/2 to test the equality of terms when youknow in advance that the terms will be ground by the time the test is made.
