ref-9-9                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                         Section 9-9: sort(+L1, -L2)sort(L1, L2) sorts the elements of the list L1 into the standard order, andremoves any multiple occurrences of an element.  The resulting sorted list isunified with the list L2.  For example,             | ?- sort([a,X,1,a(x),a,a(X)], L).            L = [X,1,a,a(X),a(x)](The time taken to do this is at worst order (N log N) where N is the length ofthe list.)If the first argument is not a proper list, sort/2 fails, and an error messageis sent to the standard error stream.
