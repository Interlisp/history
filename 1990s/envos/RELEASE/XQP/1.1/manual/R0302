ref-3-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 3-2: DisjunctionAs we have seen, the goals in the body of a sentence are linked by the operator',', which can be interpreted as conjunction (and).  It is sometimes convenientto use an additional operator '|', standing for disjunction (or).  (Theprecedence of '|' is such that it dominates ',' but is dominated by ':-'.)  Anexample is the clause            grandfather(X, Z) :-                 (mother(X, Y)                 | father(X, Y)),                 father(Y, Z).which can be read as             "For any X, Y, and Z,                X has Z as a grandfather if                either the mother of X is Y                    or the father of X is Y,                and the father of Y is Z."Such uses of disjunction can usually be eliminated by defining an extrapredicate.  For instance, the previous example is equivalent to            grandfather(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), father(Y, Z).            parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).            parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y).Therefore, disjunction will not be mentioned further in the following moreformal description of the semantics of clauses.For historical reasons, the token '|', when used outside a list, is actually analias for ';'.  The aliasing is performed when terms are read in, so that             a :- b | c.is read as if it were             a :- b ; c.Thus you can use ';' instead of '|' for disjunction if you like.Note the double use of the '.' character.  Here it is used as a sentenceterminator, while in other instances it may be used in a string of symbolswhich make up an atom (for example, the list functor '.').  The rule used todisambiguate terms is that a '.' followed by a layout-character is regarded asthe sentence terminator "full-stop", where a layout-character is defined to beany character less than or equal to ASCII 32 (this includes space, tab,newline, and all control characters).
