Consider the following alternative definitionsof the predicate type_of_character/2.  In the first definition, four clausesare used to group characters on the basis of arithmetic comparisons.            type_of_character(Ch, Type) :-                    Ch >= "a", Ch =< "z",                    !,                    Type = lowercase.            type_of_character(Ch, Type) :-                    Ch >= "A", Ch =< "Z",                    !,                    Type = uppercase.            type_of_character(Ch, Type) :-                    Ch >= "0", Ch =< "9",                    !,                    Type = digit.            type_of_character(_Ch, Type) :-                    Type = other.In the second definition, a single clause with a conditional is used.  Thecompiler generates optimized code for the conditional; the second version oftype_of_character/2 runs faster than the first and uses less memory.            type_of_character(Ch, Type) :-                    (   Ch >= "a", Ch =< "z" ->                            Type = lowercase                    |   Ch >= "A", Ch =< "Z" ->                            Type = uppercase                    |   Ch >= "0", Ch =< "9" ->                            Type = digit                    |   otherwise ->                            Type = other                    ).
