ref-6-3-16                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                    Section 6-3-16: source_file(-FileSpec)True if FileSpec is the absolute name (see {manual(ref-6-3-15)}) of a loadedfile.  If FileSpec is unbound, it is successively unified with the absolutenames of all currently loaded files.  Files loaded through the foreign functioninterface are not reported by source_file/1.If FileSpec is not the name of a loaded file, then source_file(FileSpec) simplyfails.  If FileSpec is bound to an illegal file name, source_file/1 fails,sends an error message to the standard error stream; the system then enters thedebugger in trace mode.
