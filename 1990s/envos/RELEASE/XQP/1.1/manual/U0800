user-8-0                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                            Section 8-0: OverviewXerox Quintus Prolog is very similar to Prolog-20, DEC-10 Prolog, and C-Prolog.Porting programs from any of these systems to Xerox Quintus Prolog isstraightforward:  a program is provided which examines programs written forthese other systems and identifies possible porting problems.  For anexplanation of how to use this "compatibility checker" see {manual(user-8-8)}.The rest of this appendix outlines the various areas where porting problems mayarise.
