ref-11-5                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 11-5: ancestors(-Goals)ancestors(Goals) unifies Goals with a list of ancestor goals for the currentclause.  The list starts with the parent goal and ends with a goal that wastyped at the top level.  If a goal has a compiled (and not dynamic) ancestor,then only the ancestors back as far as, and not including, the most recentcompiled (and not dynamic) ancestor will appear in the list.ancestors/1 is most often used in debugging via the debugger option 'g'.If Goals is instantiated and does not unify with the list of ancestor goals forthe current clause, ancestors(Goals) simply fails.
