ref-6-2-4                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                            Section 6-2-4: put(+N)put(N) writes N to the current output stream.  N should be a legal ASCIIcharacter code or an integer expression.  The most useful form of integerexpression in this context is a single character in double quotes, for example,"a" which evaluates to 97, the ASCII code for the letter 'a', so that:              | ?- put("a").            a            yesIf N is not a valid arithmetic expression, then put/1 fails and sends an errormessage to the standard error stream.  If N evaluates to a float, put/1 simplyfails.  If N evaluates to an integer, the least significant 8 bits are written.If the current output device is the user's terminal, the character is notnecessarily printed immediately; see ttyflush/0, {manual(ref-6-7-7)}.
