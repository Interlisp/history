ref-9-10                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                       Section 9-10: keysort(+L1, -L2)keysort(L1, L2) sorts the elements of the list L1 into order according to thevalue of Key.  The list L1 must consist of terms of the form Key-Value.Elements are scanned from left to right, yielding the list L2.  Multipleoccurrences of any term are not removed.  For example,             | ?- keysort([3-a,1-b,2-c,1-a,1-b], X).            X = [1-b,1-a,1-b,2-c,3-a](The time taken to do this is at worst order (N log N) where N is the length ofthe list.)NOTE:  The elements of L1 are sorted only according to the value of Key, notaccording to the value of Value.            |?- keysort([2-1, 1-2], [1-2, 2-1]).            yesIf any argument to keysort/2 is not what is expected, keysort/2 fails, and anerror message is sent to the standard error stream.  The system then enters thedebugger in trace mode.
