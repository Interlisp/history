ref-5-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                                Section 5-3: !Cut.  When first encountered as a goal, cut succeeds immediately.  Ifbacktracking should later return to the cut, the parent goal will fail (theparent goal is the one which matched the head of the clause containing thecut).  See {manual(ref-3-4)}, for more information.Cut has no associated error conditions.
