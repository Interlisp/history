ref-6-2                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                        Section 6-2: -X is +Expression-X is Expression evaluates Expression as an arithmetic expression (see{manual(ref-6-1)}), and unifies the resulting number with X.  Expression may bean expression made up of numbers and/or variables bound to numbers, but may notcontain variables bound to expressions.  For example,| ?- X is 4/2 + 3/7.X = 2.42857| ?- X is 2*4, 2 is X//3.X = 8| ?- X = 3 + 4, Y is X.[ERROR: variable is not bound to a number: 3+4 (error 303)][ERROR: invalid arithmetic expression: 3+4 (error 302)]noIf Expression is not an arithmetic expression, or if Expression containsvariables which are not bound to numbers, the goal fails, and an error messageis sent to the standard error stream.
