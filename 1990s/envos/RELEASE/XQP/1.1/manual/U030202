user-3-2-2                      Xerox Quintus Prolog User's Guide                Section 3-2-2: Halting the Execution of PrologIf you have worked with other Prolog systems, you are probably familiar withhalt/0, which is typed at the top-level Prolog prompt to kill a current Prologprocess.  Under Xerox Lisp, typing halt (or typing Control-z) kills the processrunning in the window in which the command is typed, but it does not destroyany consulted or compiled clauses that may have been loaded into Prolog.  Inother words, if you open another Prolog window, the previously consulted orcompiled clauses will still be accessible, unless you open it with the "StartNew Prolog" menu subitem.  For details about these options, see the XeroxQuintus Prolog System-dependent Features Manual.
