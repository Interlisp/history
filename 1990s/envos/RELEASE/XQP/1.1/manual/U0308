You can do that by usingthe initialization file 'prolog.ini'.If you use certain customized features often, you might want to direct thesystem to load them every time you start up Prolog.  You can do this bycreating an initialization file called 'prolog.ini' and editing it to containthe desired Prolog clauses.This file is consulted, if it exists, every time you start up Prolog.  Likeother files, it may contain embedded consult/1 or compile/1 directives (see{manual(user-3-4)}).NOTE:  'prolog.ini' must be resident in the directory specified by the Lispvariable LOGINHOST/DIR.
