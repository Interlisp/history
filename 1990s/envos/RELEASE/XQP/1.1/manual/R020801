ref-2-8-1                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                           Section 2-8-1: Notation   - Syntactic categories (or nonterminals) are printed in italics, for     example query.  Depending on the section, a category may represent a     class of either terms, token lists, or character strings.   - A syntactic rule takes the general form                 C --> F1                      | F2                      | F3                      .                      .                      .     which states that an entity of category C may take any of the     alternative forms F1, F2, or F3.   - Certain definitions and restrictions are given in ordinary English,     enclosed in braces ({}).   - A category written as C... denotes a sequence of one or more Cs.   - A category written as ?C denotes an optional C.  Therefore ?C...     denotes a sequence of zero or more Cs.   - A few syntactic categories have names with arguments, and rules in     which they appear may contain meta-variables in the form of     italicized capital letters.  The meaning of such rules should be     clear from analogy with the definite clause grammars described in     {manual(ref-18)}.   - In {manual(ref-2-8-3)}, particular tokens of the category Name (a     name beginning with a capital letter) are written as quoted atoms,     while tokens which are individual punctuation characters are written     literally.
