lib-7-4                     Xerox Quintus Prolog Library Manual          Section 7-4: Reading Continued Lines -- library(continued)library(continued) is an extension of library(lineio).  It defines two commandsfor reading continued lines.read_oper_continued_line(-Line)            reads a line of text, using a convention rather like that of BCPL:            an input line which ends with <op, newline> where op is a left            parenthesis '(', left bracket '[', left brace '{', or a binary            infix character from the set                        + * - / # = < > ^ | & : ,            is taken to be continued; the op character is included in the            combined Line, but the newline is not included.| ?- compile([library(printchars),library(continued)]).          . . .| ?- read_oper_continued_line(Line).|: command /option1=value1,|:    /option2=value2Line = "command /option1=value1,   /option2=value2"| ?- read_oper_continued_line(Line).|: Not continued!Line = "Not continued!"| ?- read_oper_continued_line(Line).|: x^2+|: 2*x+|: 1Line = "x^2+2*x+1"            It is likely that this will not be exactly the set of characters            you want to act as continuation indicators, and you may want some            <op> characters retained and others discarded.  That is why we make            the source code available:  this file is intended mainly as an            example.read_unix_continued_line(-Line)            uses the UNIX convention (understood by sh, csh, cc, and several            other programs) that a line terminated by a <backslash, new-line>            pair is continued, and the backslash and newline do not appear in            the combined Line.  For example,                        | ?- read_unix_continued_line(Line).                        |: ab\                        |: cde\                        |: f                        Line = "abcdef"            The following example is an extract from /etc/termcap:| ?- unix(system('cat termcap-extract')).dw|vt52|dec vt52:\    :cr=^M:do=^J:nl=^J:bl=^G:\    :le=^H:bs:cd=\EJ:ce=\EK:cl=\EH\EJ:cm=\EY%+ %+ :\    :co#80:li#24:nd=\EC:ta=^I:pt:sr=\EI:up=\EA:\    :ku=\EA:kd=\EB:kr=\EC:kl=\ED:kb=^H:dx|dw2|decwriter II:\    :cr=^M:do=^J:nl=^J:bl=^G:\    :kb=^h:le=^H:bs:co#132:hc:os:| ?- see('termcap-extract'),|    read_unix_continued_line(Line),|    seen.Line = "dw|vt52|dec vt52:    :cr=^M:do=^J:nl=^J:bl=^G:    :le=^H:bs:cd=\EJ:ce=\EK:cl=\EH\EJ:cm=\EY%+ %+ : :co#80:li#24:nd=\EC:ta=^I:pt:sr=\EI:up=\EA:    :ku=\EA:kd=\EB:kr=\EC:kl=\ED:kb=^H:"            Note that only the backslashes at the ends of the lines have been            discarded, and that the spaces beginning of the following lines            have been retained.
