ref-14-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                     Section 14-3: asserta(+Clause, -Ref)asserta(Clause, Ref) is equivalent to asserta(Clause) ({manual(ref-13-2-2)}),but returns in Ref a data base reference which uniquely identifies the newlyasserted Clause.On some systems, it is possible to guess reference numbers so as to instantiateRef to a value that will unify with the value returned by asserta/2, but thisis not recommended.  Ref should always be uninstantiated; asserta/2 fails ifRef does not unify with its return value.
