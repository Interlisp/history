Often, when beginners find unexpected backtracking occurringin their programs, they try to prevent it by inserting cuts in a rather randomfashion.  This makes the programs harder to understand and sometimes stops themfrom working.  In general, Prolog programs do not require cuts for efficiency,and none require cuts for correctness; however the cut is useful in a number ofsituations, as seen in {manual(ref-19-2-3)}.During program development, each procedure in a program should be consideredindependently to determine whether or not it should be able to succeed morethan once.  In most applications, many procedures should only succeed once;that is, they should be determinate.  Having decided that a procedure should bedeterminate, it should be verified that, in fact, it is.
