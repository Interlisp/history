ref-12-5-3                    Xerox Quintus Prolog Reference Manual                   Section 12-5-3: Advanced Control Optionsr <i>   retry previous invocation        If you supply an integer after the retry command, then this is taken as        specifying an invocation number and the system tries to get you to the        Call port, not of the current box, but of the invocation box you have        specified.  Since the invocation specified may no longer be accessible,        the result of this option will be either to return control to the        invocation specified, or to the first actually available invocation        before that point.f       fail        This is similar to Retry except that it transfers control to the Fail        port of the current box.  This places your execution in a situation in        which it is about to backtrack out of the current invocation, having        failed the goal.f <i>   fail previous invocation        This is similar to 'r <i>' except that it transfers control to the Fail        port of the invocation specified, or to the first actually available        invocation before that point.x       backup        This is intended for use at Fail and Redo ports.  When used at Call and        Exit ports, it is the same as the 'c' (creep) option.        Control is transferred back to the Call port of the most recent box        whose call has outstanding alternatives to try.  The transfer is        summarized by listing the ports of the shortest fail path from the        original box to the target box.  The shortest path will consist of a        string of Fail ports ascending the search tree followed by a string of        Redo ports descending the search tree to the target box.        This allows you to quickly back up to the most recent call with        outstanding alternatives without having to see (or stop at) irrelevant        ports.  This control mechanism does not stop at or indicate spypoints.        If the shortest fail path contains any compiled procedures, the trace        messages will be erroneous; however, the control transfer is always        completed correctly.
