The form            ( Goal -> true ; false )is also useful:  it commits to the first solution of Goal.  This operation hasa name:            once Goalonce/1 is useful when you have a nondeterminate definition for Goal, but inthis case you want to solve it determinately.  For example, to find out ifthere are any married couples, you could use            once married(_, _)If the predicate is really determinate in concept, it is better to make itdeterminate in definition as well, rather than to use once/1.
