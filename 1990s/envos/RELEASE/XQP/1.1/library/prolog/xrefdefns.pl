%   File   : XREF.DEF%   Authors: Dave Bowen, Chris Mellish%   Updated: 2/16/87%   Purpose: Examples of  definitions for use with XREF.PL.%	     System definitions are no longer needed, normally.%	     This file has only comments.  Retained for compatibility. A.V.G.%   system/1 facts may be used to tell the cross referencer which predicates%    to treat as built_in, even though predicate_property does not%    treat them as such.   Should never be needed, in principle.%   system_used/1 can be used to activate the Cross Referencer%    to flag where you use a particular built_in predicate.  For example,%    if you wanted to see where your code called the built_in predicate%    "see/2", you could specify:%%      system_used(see/2).%    or%      system_used(see(_,_)).% applies examples below show how meta_predicates had been defined to xref./*applies(call(Goal), Goal).applies(phrase(Nonterminal, List), Nonterminal+2).applies(bagof(Vars,Test,Bag), Test).applies(setof(Vars,Test,Set), Test).applies((P->Q), (P,Q)).applies(X^P, P).applies(\+G, G).*/
