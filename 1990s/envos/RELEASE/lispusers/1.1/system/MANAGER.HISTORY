This is a history of edits made to the Manager.  Please add your initials and a short description of what you changed to the END of the file.  Be sure to include the name of the definition you modified.andyiii- All menus are sorted now.andyiii - Appropiate sub-menu update when something is changed that they contain.andyiii- un-marking a file in the main menu now works and updates all the sub-menus of that file.andyiii - added option to MAKEFILE menu item for files to write CommonLisp source using common-makefile.andyiii - added commonlisp DESCRIBE for itemsandyiii - Added a way to add files to the file managers main menuandyiii - Can edit files property list from CHANGES menuandyiii - Can now mark a whole file from main menuandyiii - Can chose between TCOMPL (.LCOM files) and compile-file (.dfasl files) This is awkard since is uses the global variable *default-cleanup-compiler*andyiii - Can get CommonLisp documentation string and descriptonsandyiii - Can now PrettyPrint a value, function def, or prop list and also show how the item would be written to a fileandyiii - Cleaned up specialized menus for FNS, FUNCTIONS, VARS and PROPSandyiii - All dialog now goes through the MANAGER ACTIVITY WINDOWRAF 7/31/87 - Fixed the rename option to not specify a source file, uses the ? search (core then file).RAF 7/31/87 - Added an "edit all occurances of item's name" option to file relations menu.RAF 7/31/87 - Manager.ACTIVEFLG is now a special that is bound by all advice to avoid redundant updates inside of themselves.  This is a big speed improvement!RAF 7/31/87 - Fixed Manager.HASITEM and Manager.HIGHLIGHT to use SASSOC, so that list items in menus get highlighted properly.RAF 7/31/87 - Middle button on Manager file menu now brings up rename, etc.  Used to bring up coms to edit (inconsistent).RAF 7/31/87 - Main menu flashes if bad button/command is given.RAF 8/4/87 - MANAGER-ADDTOFILES? now initialized to NIL, reducing redundant updates.RAF 8/14/87 - In Manager.ALTERMARKING: removed extra code which tracked the files containing updated menus.  Removed call to Manager.CHECKFILE.  Made call to Manager.MAINUPDATE pass T if the reason for marking was DEFINED or DELETED; these cases also call Manager.COMSOPEN.RAF 8/15/87 - In Manager.DO.COMMAND: moved binding of ACTIVITY-WINDOW-WAS-SHRUNK into the form eval'ed in the process where references are made.  Moved setting of ACTIVITY-WINDOW-WAS-SHRUNK after the spot where its referent ACTIVITY-WINDOW is initialized.RAF 8/16/87 - Advice for LOAD and LOADFNS now call Manager.CHECKFILE instead of Manager.MAINUPDATE (latter only does highlight updating, former can rebuild main menu).  Advice for ADDTOFILES? now doesn't disable manager inside of its advised form, so that the ADDTOCOMS and DELFROMCOMS advice will work.RAF 8/17/87 - Added Manager.FILELSTCHANGED? (which is tricky, since sorting in the main menu changes its order).  Manager.CHECKFILE now tests whether the file being checked is in the main menu.  If not the main menu is rebuilt.  MANAGER fns disables manager around its call to UPDATEFILES.  Manager.GETFILE takes a prompt argument (which is now passed in by Manager.DO.COMMAND).RAF 8/18/87 - Manager.REMOVE.DUPLICATE.ADVICE now disables the manager when it manipulates the advice (to avoid animating the changes in the menus).  The advice on LOAD and LOADFNS now call Manager.REMOVE.DUPLICATE.ADVICE.RAF 8/20/87 - Fixed Manager.MAKEFILE.ADV to handle atomic cleanup options.  Also made the top level Manager.RESET call take Manager.ACTIVEFLG, so that manager stays on when reloaded if it was on already.  Manager.REMOVE.DUPLICATE.ADVICE now removes *all* duplicates of the first piece of advice (rather than only the second).RAF 8/21/87 - Made MANAGER-WINDOWS be an initvar so that Manager.RESET from top level sees the right thing on first startup.RAF 9/2/87 - Changed the manager shrunken bitmap to something more respectable.  Added ADVISE and UNADVISE menu options for the ADVICE definer.  Added a "Show all advice in effect" option to the manager main window middle button menu.  Changed the messages printed out by Manager.DO.COMMAND to all use printout and lambdafont for highlighting.RAF 9/3/87 - Added a clause in the startup fns MANAGER which reports when FILELST is empty and manager can't start.  Also fixed a bug in where marking a file didn't bold the main menu entry (added an updatefiles in Manager.ALTERMARKING).  Also caused the advice on the "redundant" call to (MARKASCHANGED :IN DEFAULT.EDITDEFA0001) to fire when FILELST is being edited (seems it was the only way to call markaschanged in that one case).RAF 11/18/87 - Changed the call to EDITDEF in Manager.DO.COMMAND to include a :DONTWAIT option.  The tracks a change in SEdit for the Mototwn release.RAF 11/18/87 - Added some type checking to the sort testing function Manager.SORT.COMS so that it doesn't convert its arguments to strings unless they're not LITATOMS.  This should make menu generation alot faster.
