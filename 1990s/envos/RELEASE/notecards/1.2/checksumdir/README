February 6, 1989===========================================================================CHECKSUM CONTROL FOR MEDLEY NOTECARDS FILES ===========================================================================If you encounter inexplicable problems shortly after you install NoteCards,they may be due to files being corrupted.  We recommend that you verify thechecksums of your installed files.===========================================================================DESCRIPTION===========================================================================The script generates checksum files named FOO.check and compares them tothe released FOO.sum residing in the /checksumdir subdirectory.  Thechecksum script reports inconsistent files, the correct checksum values forthe files, and an error message. The checksum of individual files can beverified with the UNIX command "sum filename".===========================================================================COMMANDS===========================================================================ldechecksum [-cg] ncdir[ dir | dirgroup ]	-c	Generates checksums for your installed files and compares		them with correct values.  This is the default action.	-g	Generates checksums for the files specified.	ncdir   Name of the NoteCards installation directory. Usually it's		/usr/local/lde.	dir	Any specific directory residing	under ncdir. Only		relative pathnames with respect to ncdir are accepted.	dirgroup The directory group. Valid directory groups are "sytem", 		"fonts", and "all".		"system" includes lisp, sysouts, install.sunos3.mc68020, 		install.sunos4.mc68020,	install.sunos4.sparc.		"fonts" includes the display, interpress, press and postscript		directories.				"all" includes all of the above.===========================================================================OUTPUT===========================================================================	As it begins checking each directory, the script prints a message	in the form:	Checking directory: /usr/local/lde/subdir	Error and warning messages may be one of two forms: 	< E > 36610 6973 NoteCards.sysout	indicates that file NoteCards.sysout is erroneous or does not	reside in the directory. The correct checksum of 36610, together	with the size (6973 kbytes) of the file, are shown.	< W > /usr/local/lde/fonts/display/chinese : Directory not installed 	indicates that Chinese fonts were not installed or were removed	after NoteCards was installed.===========================================================================EXAMPLES:===========================================================================	prompt% ldechecksum /usr/local/lde	All files in the installed NoteCards directories in /usr/local/lde	are checked.	prompt% ldechecksum /usr/local/somedir/lde system	This example checks all files in:	/usr/local/somedir/lde/install.sunos3.mc68020	/usr/local/somedir/lde/install.sunos4.mc68020	/usr/local/somedir/lde/install.sunos4.sparc	/usr/local/somedir/lde/lisp	/usr/local/somedir/lde/sysouts 	prompt% cd /usr/local/lde	prompt% ldechecksum  -c . fonts/display		This example checks only the display font directories.  The period	(.) is used because you are positioned under the current Medley	installation directory.
