Use this file to shift-select into your exec when you want to do a TEdit Sublooks on an entire file.  Delete the "slope" entry if you don't care about that aspect. 

Remember:
	Before you finish typing this into your Exec, make sure the mouse cursor is in the TEdit window of the file you want to change.
	Type the ending square bracket last, after you've made sure the mouse cursor is in the correct window.
