global search & replace over a group of files
(e.g., Interlisp-D > Xerox Lisp; Koto > Lyric, etc.)


access to XPSEDIT so as to write/revise macros
(e.g., IRM-style of function format; format for parameter descriptions)


expanded view of a TEDIT file, to show embedded format commands


TEDIT to show page numbers and page breaks on-screen


"go to page number" command


one-ket switch to show text on the screen with enlarged or normal-size characters (10-pt modern is hard on these old eyes) -- while keeping the page breaks the same!


UNDO to work on xpsedit commands


include a "reset" in xpsedit such that you could point to a title in order to redefine its format, and it would delete/override details of the old format such as the old hrules (much like it redefines point size and weight)


implement a switch to change uppercase <--> lowercase, init caps, etc.


wildcard character strings for search (any number, letter, alphanumeric, character, command-symbol, etc)


wildcard replace character strings: 
look for (string1)(something), 
replace with  (string2)(samething),
where something and samething are different for each instance of the search string
