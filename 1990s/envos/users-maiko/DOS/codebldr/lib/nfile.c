/* nfile.c - maximum number of open files specifier * $Version: 1.1 $ * Copyright 1991 Intel Corporation, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. * * This file is used to change the maximum number of files available to a * Code Builder process.   By default, 20 file handles are available to * each process.  If an application requires more than 20 files open * simultaneously, perform the following steps. * * 1. Change the value of _NFILE_ to the new maximum desired. * 2. Compile this module (i.e., icc -c nfile.c). * 3. Link the resulting object module with the applcation. *    a. Either explicity specify NFILE.OBJ when linking, or *    b. Replace the NFILE module in the CDOS3F.LIB library with the *       new module. * * These changes will take effect during the C start-up code to initialize * the maximum handle count and allocate the required memory for file info. * * Another method to change the maximum file handle count is through use * of the undocumented _init_handle_count function.  The description follows. * * Prototype: *   int _init_handle_count ( int new_maximum ); * *   new_maximum - Represents the desired new maximum number of file handles *                 per process.  This value must be between 20 and 255. *                 Also, it must be less than the value specified in the *                 CONFIG.SYS line FILES=n. * *   The value returned is -1 if an error occured, or the new maximum value. *   If the value returned is not equal to the value requested, the requested *   value could not be satisfied.  The return value of -1 is returned if *   the new maximum is not in the range 20 - 255, if an error occurs *   allocating the file handle buffer, or if the request to change the file *   handle count could not be satisfied.  If an error occurs, termination *   of the application is suggested. */#define _NFILE_ 20int _nfile = _NFILE_;
