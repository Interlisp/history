                      Intel 386/486 C Code Builder(TM) Kit            Copyright 1991 Intel Corporation.  All Rights Reserved.                      C Code Builder Example Programs        The C Code Builder Kit contains many example programs in the        CBPATH\EXAMPLES subdirectories.  The complexity of the examples        range from a simple program used to get familiar with the C        Code Builder tools, to issues regarding porting to the C Code        Builder environment and 32-bit extended DOS, to advanced        techniques of protected mode interrupt handling, including a        protected mode mouse handler.        A brief overview of the contents of each subdirectory is given        here.  For more detailed information, refer to the        EXAMPLES\dir\dir.RME file, where 'dir' specifies the desired        example program subdirectory (i.e., HELLO.RME).  Also, a make        file is provided for each set of example programs.  To build a        specific set of example programs, simply move to that directory        and type 'MAKE'.        DEBUG - C Code Builder Debugger Example Program         This example is used as part of the C Code Builder Debugger         tutorial as provided in chapter 2 of the "Intel 386/486 C         Code Builder(TM) Kit User's Guide."        HELLO - "Hello, world" Example Program         The classic HELLO.C program that prints "Hello, world".  This         program is used as an example in getting started using the C         Code Builder tools.        INSERT - Source Debugging Utility Example         The utility programs in this directory help correlate         compilation error messages with source text files.        INTHNDLR - Protected Mode Interrupt Handling Examples         This directory contains examples of protected mode interrupt         handlers written for the C Code Builder environment.  They may         be used as templates for your own interrupt handlers, or         used simply to gain an understanding of issues involved with         writing protected mode interrupt handlers such as installation         and chaining.        LIB - Porting Examples         The example programs in this directory originate from the         Companion Disk to the "Microsoft(reg.) C Run-Time Library         Reference" and are copyright 1990 by Microsoft(reg.)         Corporation.  They are included with the C Code Builder Kit to         demonstrate the ease of porting applications to the C Code         Builder environment and 32-bit extended DOS.  All example         programs can be compiled as-is with Microsoft C 6.0.

It demonstrates an         interrupt handler that fields mouse service requests,         including setting a real mode mouse event handler that calls         back to the protected mode mouse event handler.        TASMDEMO - Assembler Interface Example         Sample program illustrating techniques used to interface C         Code Builder programs with code written for Borland's Turbo         Assembler 2.0 or 2.5.
