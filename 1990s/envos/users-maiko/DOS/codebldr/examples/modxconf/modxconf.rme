All Rights Reserved.              Virtual Memory and Swap File Configuration Example        This program displays information pertaining to, and allows        modification of, an application's region and swap file sizes.        The files included are as follows:         MODXCONF.RME - Demonstration program information file.         MAKEFILE     - Program makefile.         MODXCONF.H   - Definitions used in MODXCON.C.         MODXCONF.C   - C Code Builder Virtual Memory Configuration                        Utility source file.        To examine or modify an application's region or swap file size,        specify its name as a command line option to MODXCONF.  If no        program name is specified, the C Code Builder tools themselves        will be the target files.  (For the latter case, however, the        CBPATH environment variable must be defined.)        Upon invoking MODXCONF, a general description of region size        and its meaning under stand-alone DOS and Windows(TM) is        displayed, followed by current region-related information        (e.g., region size, swap file size, maximum values, etc.).        A following menu allows modification of the region size and        creation or resizing of a swap file.  The region size of the        C Code Builder tools has a minimum region size limit of 2MB.        Additionally, under stand-alone DOS (i.e., Not under Windows)        at least 1MB of free extended memory is required to change the        region size.  The region size of other programs may be changed        without restrictions, except under stand-alone DOS a value        greater than the current available resources is not allowed.        To build this example program, change to this directory and        type 'MAKE'.        This source is intended for your benefit in developing        applications using the Intel 386/486 C Code Builder(TM)        Kit.  Intel hereby grants you permission to modify and        incorporate it as needed.
