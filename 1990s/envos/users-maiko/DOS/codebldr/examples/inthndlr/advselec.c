/*============================================================================= * Intel 386/486 C Code Builder(TM) Kit * Copyright 1991 Intel Corporation.  All Rights Reserved. *----------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * ADVSELEC.C - Advanced User Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler *              Selective Processing Example * * * This program demonstrates use of a protected-mode interrupt handler to * selectively process ordinary interrupts that modify registers returned to * the interrupted process.  This example modifies the operation of Int 21h, * function 41h, delete file, as an example.  The modification is to prohibit * the use of this function to delete files.  Thus, on entry to the Int 21h * handler, if function 41h is specified, the error value of 85h is placed * into the AX register, the carry flag is set and control is returned to the * caller. * * As discussed in CTLCINT.C, the EBP register contains a pointer to the * stack frame that is passed to the real-mode handler.  Similarly, the EBX * register contains a pointer to the stack frame that is returned to the * calling process.  The function _get_stk_frame can be used from a C * program to obtain the EBP register contents.  To obtain the contents of * the EBX register, an assembler routine is provided.  (See the end of this * description for an alternative if an assembler is not available). * * Through references to EBX, register values to be returned to the caller * can be modified.  The stack frame structure in the file STK.H is relevant * to both the EBP and the EBX stack frame. * * The output of this program is appended to the end of this file. * * Alternative method for obtaining EBX register value: * If an assembler is not available, but access to return registers is * necessary, a small "in-line routine" can be used.  This routine will * return the value of the EBX register pushed on the stack on entry to * the handler.  Although the actual assembler routine is reccommended, * this method may suit your purpose. * The algorithm follows: * *    Set up a 32-bit memory location (ie, an int). *    Place the hexadecimal value C310458B in this location. *    Set up a pointer that can be referenced as a function *       to point at the base of this memory location. *    Reference this pointer as a function and cast its return as int. * * The 32-bit value represents a small piece of assembly language as follows: *    8B4510   MOV eax, [ebp+10h]   ; Move ebx (from stack) to eax *    C3       RET                  ; Return eax * * The declarations and code for this method follow: * *    int _get_ebx_text = 0xC310458B;       Assembly 'routine' *    int (*_get_ebx)();                    Pointer to assembly routine * *    (int *) _get_ebx = &_get_ebx_text;    Set pointer to _get_ebx routine *    ebx = (_XSTACK *) (_get_ebx)();       Get ebx pointer * * The value returned will be the value of the EBX register on entry to the * handler. * *---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#include <stdio.h>#include <dos.h>#include <stk.h>#pragma interrupt (int21)void int21();               /* User Int 21h protected-mode interrupt handler */void (*prev_int21)();             /* Prevoius Int 21h protected-mode handler */int _get_ebx ( void );              /* Returns the value of the ebx register */void main ( void ) /* Advanced User Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler Example */   {   union REGS regs;   char filename[] = "ADVSELEC.EXE";   printf ( "Advanced User Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler Example\n\n" );   prev_int21 = _dos_getvect ( 0x21u );     /* Save previous handler pointer */   _dos_setvect ( 0x21u, int21 );            /* Install user Int 21h handler */   printf ( "\nUser Int 21h handler has been installed.\n\n" );   regs.w.eax = 0x00004100;                          /* Delete file function */   regs.w.edx = (int) filename;      /* Pointer to ASCIIZ file specification */   intdos ( (const union REGS *) &regs, &regs );       /* Invoke DOS service */   if ( regs.x.cflag )                         /* Check if an error occurred */      switch ( regs.x.ax )         {         case 0x02: printf ( "File not found\n" );                       break;         case 0x05: printf ( "Access denied\n" );                        break;         case 0x85: printf ( "Application prohibits deleting files\n" ); break;         default: printf ( "Unknown error (ax = %.4X)\n", regs.x.ax );         }   _dos_setvect ( 0x23u, prev_int21 );           /* Restore previous handler */   printf ( "\nUser Int 21h handler has been removed.\n" );   }void int21 ( void )         /* User Int 21h Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler */   {   _XSTACK *ebp;                  /* Stack frame passed to real-mode handler */   _XSTACK *ebx;              /* Stack frame returned to interrupted process */   ebp = (_XSTACK *) _get_stk_frame();            /* Get stack frame address */   if ( ebp->flg & _FLAG_VM )           /* do not process if in virtual mode */      return;   if ((ebp->eax & 0x0000FF00) != 0x4100)        /* Check for function = 41h */      return;   ebx = (_XSTACK *) _get_ebx();           /* Get return stack frame address */   ebx->eax = 0x00000085;                   /* Deleting files is not allowed */   ebp->flg |= _FLAG_CARRY;           /* Set carry flag to indicate an error */   ebp->opts |= _STK_NOINT;                      /* Bypass real-mode handler */   }/*Output of ADVSELEC.C- - - Advanced User Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler Example - - -C:\ADVSELECAdvanced User Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler ExampleUser Int 21h handler has been installed.Application prohibits deleting filesUser Int 21h handler has been removed.C:\*/
