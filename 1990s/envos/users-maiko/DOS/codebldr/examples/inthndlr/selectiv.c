/*============================================================================= * Intel 386/486 C Code Builder(TM) Kit * Copyright 1991 Intel Corporation.  All Rights Reserved. *----------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * SELECTIV.C - User Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler *              Selective Processing Example * * This program demonstrates use of a protected-mode interrupt handler to * selectively process ordinary interrupts using Int 21h, function 41h * (delete file) as an example.  The user handler intercepts calls to the * delete file function, and transparently performs other processing prior * to passing the function to the real-mode handler. * * Upon entry to the user handler, the EBP register contains the address of * a stack frame that will be eventually passed to the real-mode handler. * In C, the user handler can obtain the value of the EBP register by using * the function _get_stk_frame. This frame, as defined by the structure * _XSTACK in the file STK.H, represents the state on entry to the * real-mode handler. * * Through this stack frame, the user handler can modify registers to be * passed to the real-mode handler, or specify to bypass the real-mode * handler, as in this example.  On return from the user protected-mode * handler, the value of the stack frame field 'opts' determines further * processing.  The possible values of the field 'opts' are _STK_NOINT and * _STK_TERM as defined in STK.H.  _STK_NOINT indicates that control is NOT * to be passed to the real-mode handler, but instead, directly back to the * interrupted process.  _STK_TERM indicates that the current process is to * be terminated.  The default action is to pass control to the real-mode * interrupt handler. * * The state represented by the stack frame is relevant only to the real- * mode handler, therefore, in the case that control is NOT passed to the * real-mode handler, this stack frame is NOT used (ie, it is NOT passed * back to the interrupted process).  Therefore, it is not possible to pass * values in registers back to the interrupted process through this stack * frame.  Another point to note, this stack frame may be that of either a * protected-mode or a real-mode process.  This can be determined by * examining the field 'flag'.  The FLAG_VM bit set in this field indicates * that the interrupted process was real-mode, otherwise it was protected- * mode.  This is important to know when modifying other data in this stack * frame because of the differences in address formats (ie segmented vs. * flat).  User protected-mode handlers should be designed to handle both * interrupts from protected-mode and real-mode processes. * * The output of this program has been appended to the end of this file. * *---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#include <stdio.h>#include <dos.h>#include <stk.h>#pragma interrupt (int21)void int21();               /* User Int 21h protected-mode interrupt handler */void (*prev_int21)();             /* Previous Int 21h protected-mode handler */void main ( void )            /* Protected-Mode Selective Processing Example */   {   union REGS regs;   char filename[] = "selectiv.$$$";   printf ( "Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler "      "Selective Processing Example\n\n" );   prev_int21 = _dos_getvect ( 0x21u );     /* Save previous handler pointer */   _dos_setvect ( 0x21u, int21 );            /* Install user Int 21h handler */   printf ( "\nUser Int 21h handler has been installed.\n" );   regs.w.eax = 0x00004100;                          /* Delete file function */   regs.w.edx = (int) filename;               /* Pointer to ASCIIZ file name */   intdos ( (const union REGS *)&regs, &regs );        /* Invoke DOS service */   _dos_setvect ( 0x23u, prev_int21 );           /* Restore previous handler */   printf ( "\nUser Int 21h handler has been removed.\n" );   }void int21 ( void )         /* User Int 21h Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler */   {   _XSTACK *ebp;                                    /* Real-mode stack frame */   ebp = (_XSTACK *) _get_stk_frame();            /* Get stack frame address */   if (((ebp->flg & _FLAG_VM) == 0)      /* process only if NOT virtual mode */   && ((ebp->eax & 0x0000FF00) == 0x4100))      /* Check for function = 41h */      {                                          /* (Delete file function)   */      bdos ( 0x09, (unsigned) "\n\rQuiet save\n\r$", 0u );      /*      Quietly save a backup copy of a file to be deleted:      Get base path (or current directory) from filename specification.      if 'base path'\DELETED does not exist         create 'base path'\DELETED      Search for last occurrence of files DELETED\DELETED.???
