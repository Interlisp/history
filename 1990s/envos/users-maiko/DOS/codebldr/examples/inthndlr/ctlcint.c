/*============================================================================= * Intel 386/486 C Code Builder(TM) Kit * Copyright 1991 Intel Corporation.  All Rights Reserved. *----------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * CTLCINT.C - User Control-C Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler Example * * This program demonstrates the basic structure of and how to install a * user protected-mode interrupt handler using the Control-C interrupt as * an example. This user handler simply ignores the Control-C interrupt and * and returns to the point of interrupt without passing control to the * real-mode DOS handler. * * Upon entry to the user handler, the EBP register contains the address of * a stack frame that will be eventually passed to the real-mode handler. * In C, the user handler can obtain the value of the EBP register by using * the function _get_stk_frame. This frame, as defined by the structure * _XSTACK in the file STK.H, represents the state on entry to the * real-mode handler. * * Through this stack frame, the user handler can modify registers to be * passed to the real-mode handler, or specify to bypass the real-mode * handler, as in this example.  On return from the user protected-mode * handler, the value of the stack frame field 'opts' determines further * processing.  The possible values of the field 'opts' are _STK_NOINT and * _STK_TERM as defined in STK.H.  _STK_NOINT indicates that control is NOT * to be passed to the real-mode handler, but instead, directly back to the * interrupted process.  _STK_TERM indicates that the current process is to * be terminated.  The default action is to pass control to the real-mode * interrupt handler. * * The state represented by the stack frame is relevant only to the real- * mode handler, therefore, in the case that control is NOT passed to the * real-mode handler, this stack frame is NOT used (ie, it is NOT passed * back to the interrupted process).  Therefore, it is not possible to pass * values in registers back to the interrupted process through this stack * frame.  Another point to note, this stack frame may be that of either a * protected-mode or a real-mode process.  This can be determined by * examining the field 'flag'.  The FLAG_VM bit set in this field indicates * that the interrupted process was real-mode, otherwise it was protected- * mode.  This is important to know when modifying other data in this stack * frame because of the differences in address formats (ie segmented vs. * flat).  User protected-mode handlers should be designed to handle both * interrupts from protected-mode and real-mode processes. * * The output of this program has been appended to the end of this file. * *---------------------------------------------------------------------------*/#include <stdio.h>#include <conio.h>#include <dos.h>#include <stk.h>#include <i32.h>#pragma interrupt (int23)void int23();               /* User Int 23h protected-mode interrupt handler */void (*prev_int23)();             /* Previous Int 23h protected-mode handler */void main ( void )               /* Control-C Protected-Mode Handler Example */   {   printf ( "Control-C Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler Example\n\n" );   prev_int23 = _dos_getvect ( 0x23u  );    /* Save previous handler pointer */   _dos_setvect ( 0x23u, int23 );            /* Install user Int 23h handler */   printf ( "\n\nUser Control-C handler has been installed.\n" );   printf ( "Control-C will NOT terminate the program.\n");   printf ( "(Press <ENTER> to continue).\n" );   while ( getche() != 0x0d );              /* Loop until <ENTER> is pressed */   _dos_setvect ( 0x23u, prev_int23 );           /* Restore previous handler */   printf ( "\n\nUser Control-C handler has been removed.\n" );   printf ( "Control-C will terminate the program.\n");   while (1)      getche();                             /* Loop until control-C detected */   }void int23 ( void )         /* User Int 23h Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler */   {   _XSTACK *ebp;                            /* Real-mode handler stack frame */   ebp = (_XSTACK *) _get_stk_frame();            /* Get stack frame address */         /* Perform interrupt handling services, ie, ignore Control-C */   ebp->opts |= _STK_NOINT;                      /* Bypass real-mode handler */   }/*Output of CTLCINT.C- - - User Control-C Protected-Mode Interrupt Handler Example - - -C:\CTLCINTUser Control-C handler has been installed.Control-C will NOT terminate the program.(Press <ENTER> to continue).^C^C^C<ENTER>User Control-C handler has been removed.Control-C will terminate the program.^CC:\*/
