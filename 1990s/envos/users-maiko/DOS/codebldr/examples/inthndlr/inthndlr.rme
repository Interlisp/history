All Rights Reserved.                   Protected Mode Interrupt Handling Examples         The EXAMPLES\INTHNDLR directory contains samples of protected         mode interrupt handlers written for the C Code Builder         environment.  They may be used as "templates" for your own         interrupt handlers, or used simply to gain an understanding of         issues involved with writing interrupt handlers such as         installation and chaining.  An executable program is created         for each example.  Instructions given below describe how to         create executable programs.  Once the program has been created,         simply run the program.  Each program contains a brief         description of what it is testing, as well as instructions for         its use.  The following files are included:         INTHNDLR.RME - Example programs information file.         MAKEFILE     - Example programs make file.         CTLCINT.C    - Installs and demonstrates a user protected                        mode Control-C interrupt handler.         CHAIN.C      - Demonstrates chaining of user protected mode                        interrupt handlers.  Two handlers are chained                        to interrupt 61h, and then interrupt 61h is                        invoked.  The first handler displays 'hello,'                        and then chains to the second handler that                        displays 'world'.         SELECTIV.C   - Demonstrates intercepting and performing                        selected processing of interrupts passed to                        a real mode interrupt handler.  This type of                        processing may be required to provide                        support for interrupts not supported by the                        extender.         ADVSELEC.C   - Demonstrates the processing required to pass                        information back to the interrupted process                        from a user protected mode interrupt handler.         INT1B.C      - Control-Break interrupt handler example                        program.         INT1C.C      - Timer (interrupt 1Ch) interrupt handler                        example program.         INT23.C      - Control-C interrupt handler example program.         INT24.C      - Critical error interrupt handler example                        program.         INT2F.C      - A protected mode interrupt handler that                        provides support for the print spooler                        interrupt (interrupt 2Fh, function 1).  The                        print spooler must be installed (type "PRINT"                        at the DOS prompt) before executing this                        program.         INT23A.ASM   - Assembler version of the Control-C interrupt                        handler example program.         INT23A.OBJ   - Object file produced from INT23A.ASM using                        Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) 6.0.         INT24A.ASM   - Assembler version of Critical error interrupt                        handler example program.         INT24A.OBJ   - Object file produced from INT24A.ASM using                        Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) 6.0.         _GET_EBX.ASM - Assembly module referenced by the ADVSELEC.C                        example program. Includes a function that                        returns to a C function, the value of the                        EBX register on entry to a protected-mode                        interrupt handler.         _GET_EBX.OBJ - Object module created by the Microsoft Macro                        Assembler (MASM) 6.0.         To build the example programs, change to the EXAMPLES\INTHNDLR         directory and type "make" to compile, link, and bind each         program.  Alternatively, to build a single example, type 'make         example.exe' where 'example' is the name of the desired         program.  The INT23A.EXE and INT24A.EXE programs are a special         case.  The object modules INT23A.OBJ and INT24A.OBJ may be         created, with the appropriate assembler, as follows:             MASM 5.1:    masm /I..\..\inc INT23A.ASM;             MASM 6.0:    ml /c /Zm /I..\..\inc INT23A.ASM             Phar Lap:    386asm INT23A.ASM -i ..\..\inc\             TASM 2.x:    tasm /i..\..\inc INT23A.ASM         To build the .EXE files without the make file, type             'icc -N INT23A.OBJ' (or 'icc -N INT24A.OBJ').
