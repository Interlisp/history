All Rights Reserved. *----------------------------------------------------------------------------- * * INT2F.C * * Print spooler interrupt (0x2f, function 01h) example. * * Interrupt 2Fh, function 01h is not supported by the extender.  This file * demonstrates the use of a user-installed intercept to provide support. * The protected mode interrupt performs the processing necessary only for * the print spooler interrupt services (Int 2Fh, function 01h, * sub-functions 01h & 02h).  The interrupt could easily be expanded to * provide processing for other 2Fh services.  (Only those services which * pass or return addresses require a custom interrupt.  All other 2Fh * services are supported by the extender without any additions.) * * Sub-functions 01h and 02h of the print spooler service expect to be * called with an address in segment:offset form in registers DS:DX.  This * cannot be done directly while executing under the extender's flat memory * model.  Therefore, the address is passed in "flat" form in register EDX, * and the intercept converts this address into segment:offset form & stores * it in DS:DX.  (Note that the intercept does not actually store values * directly into registers, but rather modifies the copy of registers passed * to it in an "_XSTACK frame".  This modified copy is then passed to the * V86 interrupt handler as its input registers.) * * The print spooler must be loaded into memory (by typing 'print' from the * DOS command line) before executing this program. *****************************************************************************//*******************************************************************************  include files******************************************************************************/#include <i32.h>                       /* #pragma interrupt & _get_stk_frame */#include <dos.h>                       /* defines REGS & other structs       */#include <errno.h>#include <stdio.h>                     /* for 'perror()' of errno if error   */#include <stk.h>                       /* _XSTACK struct definition          *//*******************************************************************************  defines, structs******************************************************************************/                                       /* convrt a (low) flat addr to seg:off*/#define MAKE_SEG(low_flat) ((FP_OFF(low_flat) & 0xfffffff0) >> 4)#define MAKE_OFF(low_flat) (FP_OFF(low_flat & 0x0000000f))#pragma noalign(print_pkt)             /* must pack struct to match DOS defn */struct print_pkt                       /* struct for int 2f, func 1 call     */{   unsigned char  level;               /* always 0 in current MSDOS versions */   unsigned short fname_off;           /* off:seg form of ASCIIZ filenm addr */   unsigned short fname_seg;};/*******************************************************************************  Functions defined in this file******************************************************************************/#pragma interrupt(Int2f)               /* int 0x2f intercept                 */void  Int2f(void);/*******************************************************************************  Global variables******************************************************************************/void                *prev_2f;          /* addr of previous 2f intercept      *//*******************************************************************************  main()**  This program installs the "custom" intercept for processing interrupt 2f,*  function 1 (print spooler), subfuntions 1 & 2.

It is written to provide support*  for the print spooler service (function 01h of interrupt 0x2f).**  The intercept must ensure that it only processes those interrupt requests*  that it was intended to process.  In this case, it ensures that the request*  was issued from protected mode (not a V86 [real mode] interrupt), and that*  the request is for function 1, sub-function 1 or 2.**  Sub-functions 1 and 2 of the print spooler service expect to be called with*  an address in segment:offset form in registers DS:DX.  The address is passed*  in "flat" form in register EDX, and this routine converts the address into*  segment:offset form & stores it in the _XSTACK frame's DS:DX.**  This routine MUST be declared using '#pragma interrupt' to ensure the proper*  registers are preserved and to allow access to the _XSTACK frame.**  Input:*     An _XSTACK frame (a pointer to which is obtained by calling the routine*        '_get_stk_frame()').
