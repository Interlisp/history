It defines the data                        structure returned by the mouse driver.        MOUSETST.C      Test program that utilizes the interrupt 33h                        functions implemented in 'MOUSE.ASM'.        MT2.C           A 'child' process spawned by MOUSETST program.        MOUSE.ASM       Source code for both protected and real mode                        portions of the protected mode interrupt                        handler for interrupt 33h, functions 09h & 0Ch.                        Note, it is NOT necessary to understand or use                        this code in order to write programs using a                        mouse.        MOUSE.OBJ       Object module produced from MOUSE.ASM file.        The MOUSE.OBJ module is included in the MOUSE.LIB library in        the CBPATH\LIB directory for linking with your applications.        If linked with your application, the C startup code calls the        mouse initialization routine automatically if a mouse driver        is present at the time of program execution.  This establishes        the interrupt 33h protected mode interrupt, and also registers        an "un-install" routine, to be called upon program exit to        remove the interrupt 33h interrupt.        The source in MOUSETST.C is an example of how to write a user-        defined mouse handler.        To create the mouse test program, simply type 'make' from the        command line.  This will create two executable files:        MOUSETST.EXE and MT2.EXE.        Before executing the MOUSETST program, be certain that a mouse        driver is loaded.  To execute the demonstration, type MOUSETST        and read the test descriptions.  The file MT2.EXE is not meant        to be executed directly; It is executed by MOUSETST during the        test program.        The object module MOUSE.OBJ may be created, with the        appropriate assembler, as follows:             MASM 5.1:   masm /Mx /Ml /I..\..\inc mouse.asm;             MASM 6.0:   ml /Zm /c /Cx /Cp /I..\..\inc mouse.asm             Phar Lap:   386asm -twocase -i ..\..\inc\ mouse.asm             TASM 2.x:   tasm /mx /ml /I..\..\inc mouse.asm;        NOTE: If you DO NOT link in the Code Builder Runtime Libraries,              you must call the function '_cleanup_mouse' before              exiting to unhook the mouse handler.  The function is              found in the CDOS3f.LIB library.
