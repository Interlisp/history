                  Intel 386(TM)/486(TM) C Code Builder(TM) Kit            Copyright 1991 Intel Corporation.  All Rights Reserved.                   MASM 6.0 - C Interface Example         The \MASM6 directory contains a sample program illustrat-         ing techniques used to interface C Code Builder programs with         code written for Microsoft's MASM 6.0 Assembler.         The MASM source file was written specifically for MASM 6.0.         Refer to the TASM directory for a source file written for         Borland's Turbo Assembler (which also assembles with MASM 5.1).         If you do not have an Assembler, you may still run the make         file to create an executable file since an Assembly object         file is included.         The following files are included:         MASM.RME     - Example program's information file (this file).         MAKEFILE     - Example program's make file.         LIFE_ASM.ASM - MASM 6.0 Assembly source module containing                         C-callable routines.  Comments included in                        the file provide help in using MASM 6.0                        with C Code Builder.         LIFE_ASM.OBJ - Object module created by the Microsoft MASM 6.0                        Assembler (Options used: -Cx).         LIFE.C       - The C Code Builder source module.  Contains                        the "main()" procedure, as well as a procedure                        called by the Assembly code.         To build the example program, change to the \MASMDEMO         directory and type "make" to compile, link, and bind the         program.  Type "life" to execute the example program.
