E.g. gettimofday		is missing.E 7E 6I386		True if compiling for the Sun386i (not just any 80386);		used because the 386i's display controller is odd.OS4		True if compiling for SunOS 4.xD 2NOPIXRECT	Used to suppress pixrect/pixwin options NOT USED YET		on non-Sun machines, where they're not available.E 2I 2AIX		NOPIXRECT	Used to suppress pixrect/pixwin options when they're not		needed or not available.  True if XWINDOW is.I 6E 6AIX		True if compiling for AIX_I386		True if compiling for PS/2 under AIX (not our flag)I 5AIXPS2		True if compiling for PS/2 under AIX (our flag)E 5E 2D 4APOLLOsparcmc68020sun3E 4I 4APOLLO		True if compiling for the Apollosparc		True if we're compiling on a SPARC machine.mc68020		True if we're compiling on a Motorola 680x0 machine.D 6sun3	E 6I 6sun3		We're compiling for a Sun-3.E 6HP9000		We're compiling on an HP9000 RISC machine.HPUX		We're compiling for HP-UXRS6000		We're compiling for the RS/6000 processor.DEC3100		We're compiling for the DECStation 3100.I 6RISCOS		We're compiling for the MIPS RISCstation under RISCOS.E 6E 4UNSAFE		If true, enables the "fast" version of 68020 opcodes.NOASM		If true, suppress any attempt to include assembler		versions of things in the emulator.  In 'lispemul.c',		if this is true, disables:			SUN3_OS3_IL			SUN3_OS4_IL			SUN4_OS4_IL			OPDISP			NATIVETRAN			UNSAFE			PROFILE		and enables NOASMFNCALLC_ONLYSUN4_OS4_IL	Try assembler peephole optimizations for SPARC & SunOS4.xSUN3_OS3_IL	Try assembler peephole optimizations for 68K & SunOS 3.xSUN3_OS4_IL	Try assembler peephole optimizations for 68K & SunOS 4.xSUN3_OS3_OR_OS4_IL Try asm optimizations for 68K & either sunOS.  This is		turned on whenever either of SUN3_OS3_IL or SUN3_OS4_IL is on.D 5OPDISPSPARCDISPE 5I 5OPDISP		Use "fast-opcode-dispatch" macrosSPARCDISP	Use fast-opcode-dispatch macros on SPARCD 6	E 6I 6HPTIMERBUG	True if we must compile in the patch around the HPUX		timer-resetting bug for Series 700.E 6E 5--Debugging/Tracing/Check-enabling flags--DEBUG		Used when debugging, to enclose trace and dump code.		Best usage is with DBPRINT((controlString, args*));, which		calls printf, and compiles only if DEBUG is true.  See		dbprint.h for the definition.TRACETRACE2TRASEI 2OPTRACE		If true, the dispatch loop prints the PC & opcode each time thruFNTRACE		If true, you see the name of each function called.E 2STACKCHECK	If true, you see unusual cases of stack manipulation		traced.  E.g., the hard cases of RETURN, like non-contiguous		stack frames, get mentioned.LISPTRACE	True if you want to see LISP calls & returns traced to		stdout; Generally, for traces of lisp-level events.PROFILE		If true, the profiling control code is enabled.  You must		also change the optflags to contain -p or -pg, to use prof		or gprof, respectively.CHECKFSBCHECK	If true, you see a trace of large free stack blocks when		the stack is manipulated; was used for debugging stack code.FSMESSAGE	If true, prints a message telling you about the hard links		it makes (in support of version numbering), as it makes them.WINDOWINIT		Used when compiling an emulator to build a loadup.  Use it		to dike out code that deals with network initialization, e.g.I 4MYOPTRACE	Used to check the stack's validity on each opcode execution.		Requires NOASM, and the absence of SUN..._IL and SPARCDISP &c.E 4I 4PCTRACE		When true, compiles in a 100-long ring buffer that holds the		last 100 PCs, Function-blocks, and Opcodes executed. "pccounter"		is the offset where the next one will go.  Also requires NOASM.		The 3 tables are called pc_table, fn_table, and op_table.E 4I 4E 4--Flags that control new features, features under test, etc.--DISPLAYBUFFER	10/3/89 JDS -- enables the experimental code for copying		changed portions of the display bank to the frame buffer.		Meant for supporting mono mode on a CG6 with no single-bitD 4		bitplane.E 4I 4		bitplane. 1/22/91 JDS:  This is now the standard flag for		compiling for color displays.E 4FSERROR		Enables the emulator's returning Unix error codes for		{DSK} & {UNIX} operations, so Lisp can decode them and		give better indication of problems.  FEATURE STANDARD IN 1.1WINDOWFLIPCURSOR	If true, the "sandbar" line in the cursor will get flipped		by the C stack-frame-moving code, just as it does on a D		machine.  Otherwise, you don't see it.ORG_FILPCORSORBAR If true, you get the pixwin version of cursor changing;		otherwise, it gets done by direct writes into the display		region.OLD_CURSOR	If true, uses the pixwin cursor code (e.g., win_setcursor);		otherwise, uses the direct-write technique.NATIVETRAN	If true, code to support the native-code translator is		included in the emulator.  This feature was never released,		and most such code is probably obsolete.OS4_TYPE4BUG	If true, includes the patches around SunOS 4.0.x's failure		to tell you you've got a Type-4 keyboard.ALLDIRSEARCH	CURRENTLY HARD DISABLED IN directory.c; looks like it 		controlled recursive directory searches??KBINT		If true (it looks like??), the emulator does most of the KBD		transition processing in C, rather than interrupting LISP for		it, and the transition interrupts happen when the OS signals		a transition, rather than by polling?RS232INT	If true, the RS232 device (NOT USED, a translation of Lisp's		code), uses the interrupt signalling support of timer.c to		know when to read characters.  NOT USED, probably obsolete.TTYINT		Analogous to RS232INT, for the translated TTY device.ETHERINTD 3COLORE 3I 3COLOR		If TRUE, supports 8bits-per-pixel color on CG4 and CG6 frame		buffer of Sun work station. IF COLOR is TRUE, don't use OLD_CURSOR 		flag.E 3CATCH		If true, includes some CATCH C code, for finding the blip,		finding variable names and PVAR names in frames.  As of 10/2/89		this code is unused, and is called nowhere else in the system.RECLAIMINC	If true, then the RECLAIMCELL opcode calls gcreclaimcell in		C; otherwise it punts.  As of 10/3/89, this was never debugged		and is not in any system.  Probably fairly easy to debug??KB_SUN4		The kbd type for the Type-4 keyboard.  Defined only because		older OS versions of the compiler don't define it automatically.FUJI		If true, and you don't set the LDEKBDTYPE environment variable,		you'll get a nasty message asking you to set it before		running lisp.  Otherwise, you'll default to a type-3 kbd.FLTINT		If true, use the floating-point exception interrupts to detect		errors and overflows on FP operations.  The interrupt sets a		global error flag.  Otherwise, calls library routines to see		the condition code from each operation.  For SPARCs, it's not		clear that the interrupt trick works, because of code re-		arrangement by the C compiler.BUFFER		Used (apparently) only in testdisplay.c to decide if it should		read the sysout directly, or buffer each page.IFPAGE_DEFINED	Used in .h files to prevent redefinition of Interface page.IOPAGE_DEFINED	" for IO page definition.NOWAY		Used to dike out C definitions of RPLACA and RPLACD in the		file car-cdrmacro.hI 2XWINDOW		True if compiling for an X-windows emulator.I 4BIGATOMS	True if this emulator will support 3-byte symbols, instead of		the old, 2-byte atom numbers.I 6NEWBITBLT	True if we want to use assembler BITBLT code, rather than		have code created inline by macro calls.E 6E 4E 2bitbltsub.c:#ifdef GETBASEtestdisplay.c:#ifdef NOTUSEDuraid.c:#ifdef ETHERINTbitblt.c:#ifndef COLORbitbltsub.c:#ifndef prropstylelispmap.h:#ifdef MEDLEYE 1
