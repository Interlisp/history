Errors should happenvery seldom and thus, should not require the use of the checksum controlvery often.===========================================================================DESCRIPTION===========================================================================The script will generate checksumfiles named FOO.check and compare them tothe released FOO.sum residing in directory "medleydir"/checksumdir.Inconsistent files together with their correct checksum values will bereported with an error message. The checksum of individual files can begenerated with the Unix command "sum FOO".===========================================================================COMMANDS===========================================================================ldechecksum [-cg] [ medleydir[ dir | dirgroup ]]	-c	(default) generate checksumfiles FOO.check and compare with		released FOO.sum.	-g 	generate checksumfiles "FOO.sum".	medleydir name of the Medley installation directory. Default is		/usr/local/lde.	dir	any specific directory residing	under medleydir. Only		relative pathnames with respect to medleydir are accepted.	dirgroup is either all (default) or lisp, the later meaning		X/install, X/lisplibrary and X/lispsysouts directories.===========================================================================OUTPUT===========================================================================	The script will print a series of information messages in the	following form: 	Checking directory: /usr/local/lde/BAR 	Error and warning messages are of the form: 		Checking directory: /usr/local/lde/lisplibrary	< E > 32711 49 4045XLPSTREAM.DFASL 	indicating that file 4045XLPSTREAM.DFASL under X/lisplibrary is	erroneous or does not reside in the directory. The correct checksum	32711 is shown.  	or 	< W > /usr/local/lde/fonts/display/chinese : Directory not installed 	indicating that chinese fonts were not installed or were removed	after the Medley installation.===========================================================================EXAMPLES:===========================================================================	prompt% ldechecksum	In this example all the installed Medley directories residing in	/usr/local/lde are checked.	prompt% ldechecksum /usr/local/somedir/lde lisp 	In this example a checksum is performed on all files in:	/usr/local/somedir/lde/install /usr/local/somedir/lde/lisplibrary	/usr/local/somedir/lde/lispsysouts	prompt% ldechecksum  -c . fonts/display		In this example only the display font directories under current	Medley directory are checked.E 1
