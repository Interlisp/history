Changes made after the official RELEASE date 1. I had to change the makefile-tail-* files because of a bugin "makeright release". The variable INSDIR was being set inmakeright as well as in makefile-tail*. Commented it out in themakefile-tail* files.2. Also the usermakefile* have been changed to properly reflect the way lde ldesingle and ldemulti are interlaced.Carl Gadener 7/19/90
